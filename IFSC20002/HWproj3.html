<p><strong>HWproj3*</strong><strong>, Ethics in the Profession</strong></p>
<p>Note: Professional neatness and clarity of format count! Do it like <em><strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/hw3proj-answer-template/">this</a></strong></em><em><strong>.</strong></em></p>
<ol>
<li>Provide an update on your plans regarding how or whether to use ChatGPT or other AI tools. Explain and justify. Recall  the <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2023/01/16/ada">1,390 word short story the instructor produced in about 20 minutes</a> using ChatGPT. Recall the <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2023/02/05/6332/">information</a> we provide about using these tools.</li>
<li>For your ethics-related term project (see “Course Information” tab for details): Let us continue to develop it step by step over the semester so that it will be manageable rather than a crunch at the end, as follows. Write up another 350 words or more (per person if a group project) of new content if your project is a paper that must be written from scratch (for example if it is about yourself). If you are using an automatic text generator to help write it it would probably be <strong>quite a bit more than that amount</strong> of words. If the progress was code development or website creation, give the new code. If slides, paste the new text from the new slides into your blog and describe any images or graphics. If something else, explain specifically what you did, being sure to give examples if that makes sense. Label this HW consistently as in <em><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/hw3proj-answer-template/">this</a></em> example. IMPORTANT: No credit on this HW if you copy-paste material from an earlier HW. List any sources you used, such as websites or pages, ChatGPT or other tools, books, or whatever it might be. This takes some effort and it counts as part of your work.</li>
<li>Explain what needs to be done next on the project. Put this in your blog, labeling it consistently as in <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/hw3proj-answer-template/">this</a> example.</li>
</ol>
<p>Title your blog post "HWproj3."</p>
<p>*Late assignments:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably wouldn’t check it again, resulting in no credit.</li>
<li><span style="color: var(--color-text);">After the due date of the next project assignment (HWproj4), this assignment (HWproj3) will not be accepted. Instead, do HWproj4.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This addresses the "Implementation" block of the waterfall software engineering life cycle model</p>
