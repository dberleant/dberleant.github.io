<h1><strong>HWproj5*</strong></h1>
Note: Neatness and format count! Do it like<em> <strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2004/03/15/hw5proj-answer-template/">this</a>.</strong></em><strong> </strong>
<ol>
 	<li>Explain how you used ChatGPT or other AI tool(s) to help for this HW's update to your project, or note if it wasn't used.</li>
 	<li>Continue to develop the project, as we build it step by step over the semester so that it will be manageable rather than a crunch at the end, as follows. Write up another 350 words or more (per person if a group project) of new content if your project is a paper that must be written from scratch (for example if it is about yourself). If you are using an automatic text generator to help write it it would probably be <strong>quite a bit more than that amount</strong> of words. If the progress was code development or website creation, give the new code. If slides, paste the new text from the new slides into your blog and describe any images or graphics. If something else, explain specifically what you did, being sure to give examples if that makes sense. Label this HW consistently as in <em><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2016/07/13/hw3proj-answer-template/">this</a></em> example. List any sources you used, such as websites or pages, ChatGPT or other tools, books, or whatever it might be. This takes some effort and it counts as part of your work. If your project is not a paper, explain what you did on your blog. For team projects, focus on your own activities although you can also discuss the overall effort to provide some context. Explain and give evidence (for example, if a web site, you could provide a link to it; if software, give the code; if a skit, give some of the script or list rehearsal or meeting times; if artwork, provide an image showing its status, etc.).  If you're not sure what to do, see me or send me an email and I will try to suggest something.</li>
</ol>
<em>Hint</em>: IMPORTANT - No credit on this HW if you copy-paste material from an earlier HW.

<em>Hint</em>: To see the word count, copy into MS Word and look at the little status bar in the lower left corner of its window. OpenOffice Writer has a tool that you can click on to find out the # of words. Let me know if you can't find it.

<em>Hint</em>: Make a blog entry titled "HWproj5." Format your blog entry like <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2004/05/25/hw4proj-answer-template">this</a>.

*Late assignments:
<ul>
 	<li>They must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably wouldn’t check it again, resulting in no credit.</li>
 	<li><span style="color: var(--color-text);">After the due date of the next project assignment (HWproj6), this assignment (HWproj5) will not be accepted. Instead, do HWproj6.</span></li>
</ul>
