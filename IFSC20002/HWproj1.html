<h2><span style="color: #000000"><strong>HWproj1*</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000">For your ethics-related term project (see course information tab for details): We want the project to be manageable rather than a big crunch at the end of the semester. So, you will be developing it step by step (starting now!) so it will be nearly done by the end of the semester.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">This week you will brainstorm about what topic(s) you might like to explore for your project, and what sort of formats you might choose from (report, fictional story, computer program, skit, video, music, rap, art, web site, 45-minute presentation which you would hand in but not present, practical project with an ethical aspect to it, etc., etc.). Note that it can be either an individual project, or a team project with whoever you want to work with.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Professional neatness and clarity of format counts! Make it look like this<em> <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline"><strong><a style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/">example</a></strong>.</span></span></em></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">1. List 1 or more possibilities you are considering for a project <em>topic</em>. There should be some connection to the course, but mostly it is up to you – seek topic(s) that you would find interesting to dig into. Length requirement: at least 10 sentences or bullet points listing topics and/or things about topic(s). Put your answer in your blog like the <em><a style="color: #000000" href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/">example</a></em><em>.</em></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">2. List possibilities for project <em>format</em>, the pluses and minuses of each, and your preferences and opinions. Also discuss the question of individual vs. group project. Include plans for using ChatGPT or other AIs. See <a style="color: #000000" href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2023/02/05/6332/"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff"><span style="text-decoration: underline">some guidelines</span></span></strong></a>. Will you use it? If so, how? Give a decision about format and plans, or if you can't decide yet, say where you are in the decision process. Length requirement: at least 10 sentences or bullet points. Put your answer in your blog like the <span style="text-decoration: underline"><span style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline"><em><a style="color: #0000ff;text-decoration: underline" href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/">example</a></em><em>.</em></span></span></span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">3. (a) Go the the "Course Information" tab on the course web site. Read about the course, especially the parts about the project. Note on your blog any questions you have, or note that you don't have any questions, like in the <em><a style="color: #000000" href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/">example</a></em>. (b) Then go to the "Syllabus" tab on the course web site.  Read over it. Note on your blog any questions you have, or note that you don't have any questions, like in the</span> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/">example</a></span>.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Title your blog post "HWproj1."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>*Late assignments:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">They must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably wouldn’t check it again, resulting in no credit.</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">After the due date of the next project assignment (HWproj2), this assignment (HWproj1) will not be accepted. Instead, do HWproj2 and hand that in.</span></li>
