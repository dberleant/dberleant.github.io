<strong>Put answers to question 1 and question 3 in separate blog posts. Question 2 is comments on blog posts, not a blog post of its own.</strong> (If late, email it instead.)*
<br><br>
<strong>Q1</strong> <strong>(33 pts. max, 16.5 min)</strong> Prepare case notes on an ethics case related to ethics in the workplace. (A case about moral injury is an option you could consider.) <span style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">An ethics case is an example, event, experience, legal case, medical case, and so on from real life, a movie, your imagination, and so on, which </span><em style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">has some ethics related aspects to consider</em><span style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">. </span><span style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">Post your notes to your blog. </span>Your notes should include the following.
<ul>
 	<li>A link or other citation to the case you are using, or if it is from personal experience, point that out.</li>
 	<li>A list of <strong>8 or more important <em>facts </em></strong>about the case, in your own words.These will tell the reader enough about the case to be able to address the questions you will suggest (see bullet points below) for them to consider.</li>
 	<li>A list of <strong>questions (3 or more)</strong> you could ask your group members in order to get an interesting and enlightening discussion going (for in-class students), or that you could consider yourself or ask someone else about (for online students); see the “Questions to ask during discussion” tab on the course web page for some suggestions in developing your discussion questions.</li>
 	<li>A 4<strong>th discussion question</strong> about how computer security relates to or could relate to the case. The computer security question could be about hacking, viruses or worms, theft of information, piracy, abuse of privileges, destruction of assets, information privacy, disruption of operations, unauthorized access, corporate abuse of information or computing, government abuse of information, physical harm, or any other issue in the general area of computer security.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Hint</em>: For your case for this unit, one option you have is to look for a case involving <strong>moral injury</strong>. Some types of work can cause that type of injury. Military work can cause this. It <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/08/02/1191446579/doctors-have-their-own-diagnosis-moral-distress-from-an-inhumane-health-system">can happen in health care</a> as well. Whatever case you decide on, you can use news articles, personal experience, things you found on the web, on paper, etc.</p>

<ul>
 	<li>Add the following three additional questions to your list of questions:
<ul>
 	<li>What does virtue ethics say about this case?</li>
 	<li>What does utilitarianism say about this case?</li>
 	<li>What does deontology say about this case?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Q2 (33 pts. max, 16.5 min)</strong>

Option 1: Come to class for both case discussion days (2 of them per unit) and we will discuss your case and other students' cases.

Option 2: Go to the blogs of some other students, find where they posted discussion questions as their answer to Q1 above, and comment on their posting with a <strong>reply</strong>. Every posting should have a clickable <strong>reply </strong>link below it. Add a <strong>reply</strong> on either a discussion questions, or <strong>reply</strong> to someone else's <strong>reply</strong>. A total of six comments are specified, spread across anywhere from one to six students. It could be cool to get a thread going! One or more of your comments should concern virtue ethics, utilitarianism, or deontology. <strong>Here is a <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/bog-roll">list of students’ blogs</a> that you can reply to.</strong>

<strong>Important note: </strong>If you finish Q2 late, then email your answers instead of posting them as comments. Why? Because, after Q2 is due, we will go through all the blog posts and tabulate students' comments. If you post a late comment after that, we won't see it.

Options 1 and 2 Combined: Well, if you want to attend the first discussion day videoconference, but instead of attending the second day, comment on blogs instead, that can work too. In that case you need to email the instructor that you did it this way, so that you get credit for it in case the grader had already checked all the blogs for comments before you posted yours.

<br><br>
<strong>Q3 (34 pts. max, 17 min)</strong> Finally, discuss your case with ChatGPT, Claude.ai, or a similar AI system. The way to discuss it is to ask the AI to teach you about the ethics of the case by asking you a question which you answer. It then should follow up with another question, then another, and so on. Post a transcript of the session with the AI.

Post two things: (1) Your experience reflections about how to best get the AI to exercise your mind and learn about the ethics of this case, and (2) a transcript of the session with the AI. See <strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/my-answers-to-hw1case-q3/">this example</a> </strong>and this<strong> <a href="https://us-lti.bbcollab.com/recording/ae6d58494a084051b0bab6afa277fd1e">video</a></strong>.

Professional neatness and clarity of format counts!

*Late assignments must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably would score it as missing, and not check it again.
