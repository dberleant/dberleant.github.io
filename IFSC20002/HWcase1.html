<p><strong>Q1 is in its own blog posting. Q2 is in class or on other peoples' blogs. Q3 is in its own blog posting. </strong>(If late, email it instead.)*</p>
<p><strong>Q1</strong> <strong>(33  pts. maximum, 16.5 minimum)</strong> Prepare case notes on an ethics case related to intellectual property. <span style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">An ethics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_study">case</a> is an example, event, experience, legal case, medical case, and so on from real life, a movie, your imagination, and so on, which </span><em style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">has some ethics related aspects to consider</em><span style="color: var(--color-neutral-600)">. You are encouraged but not required to pick a case related to ChatGPT and other modern AIs that output text or images. Just do a web search using a query similar to<br /></span></p>
<p><strong>generative AI ethical issues</strong></p>
<p>The term "generative" here refers to AI systems like ChatGPT that generate stuff (text, images, whatever). If you leave the term out, the search will return a lot of ethical issues related to other kinds of AI like smart weapons, robots and other things.</p>
<p>Post your notes to your blog. Your notes should include the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>A link or other citation to the case you are using, or if it is from personal experience, point that out.</li>
<li>A list of 5 or more<strong> important <em>facts</em> </strong>about the case in your own words. These will tell the reader enough about the case to be able to address the questions you will suggest (see bullet points below) for them to consider.</li>
<li>A list of <strong><em>questions</em> (3 or more)</strong> that could get an interesting and enlightening discussion going if you were in a discussion group, or that you would find interesting to consider. See the “Questions to ask during discussion” tab on the course web page for some suggestions in developing your discussion questions.</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><em>Hint</em>: To find cases to discuss related to the theme of this unit, intellectual property, you could for example do a web search on:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">ethics cases</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">or use news articles, personal experience, things you found on the web, on paper, etc. Professional neatness and clarity of format counts!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add the following three additional questions to your list of questions:
<ul>
<li>What does virtue ethics say about this case?</li>
<li>What does utilitarianism say about this case?</li>
<li>What does deontology say about this case?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your blog post look like <strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/my-answers-to-hw1case-q1/">this example</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Q2 (33 pts. max, 16.5 min)</strong></p>
<p>Option 1: Come to class for both case discussion days (2 of them per unit) and we will discuss your case and other students' cases.</p>
<p>Option 2: Go to the blogs of some other students, find where they posted discussion questions as their answer to Q1 above, and comment on their posting with a <strong>reply</strong>. Every posting should have a clickable <strong>reply </strong>link below it. Add a <strong>reply</strong> on either a discussion questions, or <strong>reply</strong> to someone else's <strong>reply</strong>. A total of six comments are specified, spread across anywhere from one to six students. It could be cool to get a thread going! One or more of your comments should concern virtue ethics, utilitarianism, or deontology. <strong>Here is a <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2018/01/27/bog-roll">list of students’ blogs</a> that you can reply to.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px"><strong>Important note: </strong>If you finish Q2 late, then email your answers instead of posting them as comments. Why? Because, after Q2 is due, we will go through all the blog posts and tabulate students' comments. If you post a late comment after that, we won't see it.</p>
<p>Options 1 and 2 Combined: Well, if you want to attend the first discussion day videoconference, but instead of attending the second day, comment on blogs instead, that can work too. In that case you need to email the instructor that you did it this way, so that you get credit for it in case the grader had already checked all the blogs for comments before you posted yours.</p>
<p><strong>Q3 (34 pts. max, 17 min)</strong> Finally, discuss your case with ChatGPT, Claude.ai, or a similar AI system. The way to discuss it is to ask the AI to teach you about the ethics of the case by asking you a question which you answer. It then should follow up with another question, then another, and so on.</p>
<p>Post two things: (1) Your experience reflections about how to best get the AI to exercise your mind and learn about the ethics of this case, and (2) a transcript of the session with the AI. See <strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2018/11/01/my-answers-to-hw1case-q3/">this example</a> </strong>and this<strong> <a href="https://us-lti.bbcollab.com/recording/ae6d58494a084051b0bab6afa277fd1e">video</a></strong>.</p>

<hr />
<p>*Late assignments must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably would score it as missing, and not check it again.</p>
