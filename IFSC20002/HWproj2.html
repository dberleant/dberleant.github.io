<strong>Ethics in the Profession, </strong>

<strong>HWproj2</strong><strong>*</strong>
<br><br>
<em>Hint 1</em>: Professional neatness and clarity of format counts! See this<em> <strong><a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2005/04/19/hw2proj/">example</a></strong>.</em>
<br><br>
<em>Hint 2</em>: Are you still looking for a topic to choose for your project? Since we are now in the "Ethics in the Workplace" unit, it seems like a good time to consider, as a topic, <strong>moral injury</strong>. It's interesting. Look it up. It occurs in combat veterans (and drone operators), as well as in civilian jobs like law, police work, medicine and other areas.
<br><br>
<em>Hint 3</em>: Title your blog post "HWproj2."
<br><br>
For your ethics-related term project (see “Course Information” tab for details): Let us continue to develop it step by step over the semester so that it will be manageable rather than a crunch at the end, as follows. Write up a plan of 200 words or more (per person if a group project) for your project. Include in your plan <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2023/02/05/6332/"><strong>how you plan to use, or not use, ChatGPT/DALL-E/Stable Diffusion</strong></a> or other AI assistants in your project, or if you do not, why not. For some projects (papers, websites, etc.) a bulleted outline of the expected content might be appropriate as a plan. Other aspects to consider including in a plan might be the steps to take, or whatever is appropriate for the project. Put this in your blog, labeling it consistently as in <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2014/08/27/check-the-syllabus/https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/2005/04/19/hw2proj/">this</a> example.

*Late assignments:
<ul>
 	<li>They must be emailed directly to the instructor, because if we checked your blog and it was missing we probably wouldn’t check it again, resulting in no credit.</li>
 	<li><span style="color: var(--color-text);">After the due date of the next project assignment (HWproj3), this assignment (HWproj2) will not be accepted. Instead, do HWproj3.</span></li>
</ul>
