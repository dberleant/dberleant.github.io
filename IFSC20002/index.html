<p><strong>Catalog Description: </strong>This course is a survey of ethics and its applications to the computing and information technology professions. It has the twin objectives of (<em>i</em>) studying professional codes of ethics and the responsibilities that they place on technology professionals, and (<em>ii</em>) investigating the background and implications of ethical aspects of the real-world professional environment. Two hours of lecture per week. Two credit hours.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites: </strong>none.</p>
<p><strong>Student Learning Outcomes: </strong>At the end of this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li>apply the concepts of deontological, utilitarian, and virtue ethics in analyzing ethical problems, including problems occurring within the profession;</li>
<li>lead and contribute to group or online discussions, which is a valuable teamwork skill in the profession;</li>
<li>produce as a project a creative work of significant scale, which is often required for advancement within the profession.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Grading:  </strong>HWs will be scored on a scale from a low of 50% for something not handed in, to a high of 100% for a perfect score. This algorithm works better than the more commonly used approach (see Douglas B. Reeves, "The Case Against the Zero," Phi Delta Kappan, Vol. 86, No. 4, December 2004, pp. 324-325, <a href="http://missionliteracy.com/uploads/3/1/5/8/3158234/caseagainstzero.pdf">http://missionliteracy.com/uploads/3/1/5/8/3158234/caseagainstzero.pdf</a>).</p>
<p>Your current grades are <a href="https://blackboard.ualr.edu">here</a>. The scale is:    A: 90-100     B: 80-90     C: 70-80     D: 60-70     F: 50-60</p>
<p><strong>Assignments:</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Homeworks (100 pts. each, with a minimum of 50 pts.)</span>.</p>
<p>There will be 6 units, or general topics, in the course. Each unit will take approximately four class sessions (two weeks). In each unit there will be two HWs: a <em>case study</em> HW and a <em>project progress</em> HW.</p>
<ol>
<li>The case study HWs are named HWcase1, HWcase2, HWcase3, HWcase4, HWcase5 and HWcase6, and involve preparing detailed discussion notes about an ethics case that you find.</li>
<li>The project progress HWs are named HWproj1, HWproj2, HWproj3, HWproj4, HWproj5 and HWproj6, and involve making incremental progress on a semester project.</li>
<li>There is also an orientation assignment, HW0; project presentation HW7 which is to create a short presentation of your project; and the project itself which counts as two HWs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thus, some HWs will relate to the current class topic, and some will relate to the semester project.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px">Late HWs:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol>
<li>10% off if your HW is up to 1 week late.</li>
<li>25% off for HWs over 1 week late (unless item "3." or "4." below applies).</li>
<li>Automatic score of 50 for HWproj1 submitted after the due date for HWproj2, or for HWproj2 submitted after the due date for HWproj3, and so on. In other words, 50 pts. for HWprojN after the due date of HWprojN+1. Instead, just work on the next proj HW.</li>
<li>A score of 50% each for multiple HWs submitted in a rush at the end of the semester.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Attendance (10 pts. for each lecture session)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Students in a section with specific meeting times.</strong> This might be in a classroom or by videoconference. Attend the class to get this credit. If you are sick or have some other valid reason, please let me know to avoid losing points. 2.5 pts. off for arriving late or leaving early without a reason.</li>
<li><strong>Students in an online section without a specific meeting time</strong> (called an "asynchronous" class. Post notes on the lectures to your blog to get this credit. 2.5 pts off if late. Notes on multiple lectures submitted in a rush at the end of the semester will be counted the same as if not handed in at all. For further details see the syllabus entry for each lecture.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Short presentation (100 pts.)</span></p>
<p>This is normally a presentation about your final project. Five quality minutes (including questions from the audience if there is an audience). Students in a section without a specific meeting time will submit slides, a script, a video, etc., as appropriate, that they would use if they were actually going to do a presentation. Want more information about giving presentations?</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Final project: A creative product with an ethics related component. May be a paper (or in this age of AI a book, written using AI to help), video, video game, computer program, web site, skit, rap, original musical performance, interviews with professionals in the field, or any other kind of creative product approved by the instructor (200 pts.</span><span style="text-decoration: underline">)</span>.</p>
<p>This should relate to ethics, but the precise topic is up to you (subject to instructor approval). A project is something you will learn from, and remember, for many years to come, unlike a smaller HW. Thus, it is a valuable educational experience. Luckily, the final project is not a huge assignment due all at once. Instead, the final project will be developed in guided steps assigned as HWs, to make it happen in a convenient step-by-step way rather than being a big push at the end of the semester. Some people have done papers in past semesters, and many have done other kinds of projects. For papers, in most cases this semester you should use ChatGPT, Claude.ai or another AI tool to help, resulting in a considerably more ambitious paper than you could do by yourself (if you don't edit the output a lot, you could create an entire book, which would make a fun project). Types you could consider are (1) a research report on an ethics-related topic (examples: music sharing sites, something in the news, etc.), (2) a creative writing piece in which you write a fictional account where ethics plays a significant role, (3) an essay exploring ethics as it relates to your own life, plans, an actual incident you had to deal with, etc., (4) creating an ethical code (and explaining/discussing it) for a hypothetical or real group of people with some common interest, job, or activity, (5) an <a href="https://ifsc2200ethics.wordpress.com/celebrity-ethics/">ethical analysis of a celebrity</a>'s life or some event a celebrity is involved in, using ethics ideas discussed in this course, (6) some other type of paper, or (7) a book written with AI assistance. Other types of final projects are also popular, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A home-made video. You could do this alone or with a group. You could use animation or make some other kind of video. You could make a skit and record it. </li>
<li>An original musical performance. You could write a song and play it live for the class, or record it. </li>
<li>A computer program. It can do something with an ethics connection, or be a game with an ethics component, or some other kind of program. There are lots of possibilities.</li>
<li>A web site. It can be informative, for example. It can focus on content, like a paper, but be in the form of a site. Some of the work involved in the project therefore involves developing content (you can use an AI to help develop this) and some is technical development.</li>
<li>A skit. This can be done individually or as a group. Take a video of it. You can ask people you know to help play parts or others in the class could join the group as a group project (I can help find other students). Or you could play everything yourself. You could recruit your little cousins to play parts in it. Former student IH wrote: "For my final project I wrote and recorded a play on bullying and recorded my little cousins acting it out. They are all grown up now and they love watching it back and reminiscing on the hard work they put in."</li>
<li>A class-length presentation (this is <em>in addition</em> to the 5 minute presentation requirement everyone has to do). You would prepare a 50 minute presentation using slides (powerpoint, impress, prezi, or some other technology), record the presentation as a video and hand in that as the project. </li>
<li>A rap. Similar to the song option, you would develop a rap with some ethical connection, and perform it (or show a video of it) for the class. Like the song option, you might feel a bit nervous or love an audience, but either way, the other students have always liked it in the past!</li>
<li>A practical project such as community service or other socially beneficial activity (but <em>not</em> connected to a political entity or ideology - that's outside the scope of this course).</li>
<li>People have also done other types of projects, such as an original painting. Paintings are more popular a project than you might guess. If your product is computer art not involving physical media, then you can use AI to help.</li>
<li>Pick whatever type project would be of interest to you. Individual or group projects are both good. The length target for a non-AI-assisted paper is 2,250 words per person, but a paper written with help from an AI would be quite a bit longer, obviously. Other kinds of projects should be of equivalent effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>For writing projects (or other assignments involving writing), the university provides the following resource that encourages you to contact them.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><strong>General Course Structure:  </strong>We will discuss specific case studies chosen by students for each of the (approximately) six ethics units covered. Each student will choose cases that they find on the web, in the news, from books, from personal experience or that they have heard about, and so on. Cite your sources if they are publicly accessible. The units (as time allows) typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, piracy, plagiarism, etc.)</li>
<li>(2) Ethics in the workplace (whistle blowing, surveillance, anti-competitive practices, free trade, taxation, fraud, regulation and deregulation, etc.)</li>
<li>(3) Ethics in computing/science/engineering/etc. research</li>
<li>(4) Ethical codes (for your profession, etc., could propose your own code of ethics for some purpose such as boy-/girlfriend, parent, student, boss, worker, etc.)</li>
<li>(5) Computer security (electronic voting, identify theft, social network bullying/stalking/abuse, other online crimes such as exploitation)</li>
<li>(6) Ethics, AI and robots</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emergency plans (mostly for sections meeting in a classroom):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>University inclement weather policy: </strong>See <a href="http://ualr.edu/policy/home/admin/weather">ualr.edu/policy/home/admin/weather</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Pandemics: </strong>We will follow policies on masks, social distancing, meetings or cancellations thereof, and any other public health recommendations, policies, and procedures provided by the university, governmental entities, and instructor judgment.</li>
<li><strong>Instructor illness: </strong>If the instructor becomes ill, the course will continue using published due dates, assignments, and pre-recorded lectures and/or published lecture notes.</li>
<li><strong>Student illness: </strong>Please let the instructor know so that allowances can be made in terms of due dates and other appropriate accomodations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Academic integrity: </strong>University policies are: <a href="https://ualr.edu/deanofstudents/section-vii-administration/academic-integrity-grievance-policy/">Academic Integrity and Grievance Policy</a>, <a href="https://ualr.edu/deanofstudents/section-vii-administration/academic-offenses/">Academic Offences</a>, and <a href="https://ualr.edu/deanofstudents/academic-integrity/">Academic Integrity</a>. Note that in this course plagiarism (copying without crediting the original) is not allowed. We will discuss what plagiarism is and why it is not allowed. No credit for any assignment which contains any plagiarism, even a little bit. Let's suppose an assignment is handed in late in the semester that contains plagiarism. We could then look back at earlier HWs, recheck them, and update the scores of any with plagiarism accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Regular and Substantive Interaction:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The instructor is available for student-initiated contact during business hours by email (preferred) as well as by phone (leave a message if no answer and I will respond to it), in my office in EIT 562 if I am present, and after class. I also respond to emails outside of business hours. If you do not get a response to your email within 24 hours, please resend it as it may have fallen through the cracks.</li>
<li>Asynchronous online students will have their blogs accessed regularly, assignments evaluated and the grades provided, and will be sent emailed messages with information, suggestions, hints, or requests to respond with any questions or confusions. Students are encouraged to reach out with any questions or concerns throughout the semester. The instructor is aware of class progress and is responsive to it. We will notice your progress in the course and if a student appears to have ceased meaningful participation in the course the student will be administratively dropped in accordance with university and governmental rules. (However, not all instructors reliably do this, so if you want to drop a course, be sure to do it by the deadline yourself, or after the deadline, talk directly with the professor to let them know wish to cease regular and substantive interaction and would they please drop you administratively. Then you would get a "W" which is usually <strong>much</strong> better than an "F.")</li>
</ol>
<div><strong>Accomodations</strong>: If you are a student with a disability, or if you simply want to discuss resources that might help you learn more effectively, you can contact the Disability Resource Center at any time. You are welcome to drop in or call 501-916-3143 to make an appointment. Their staff will work with you to discuss accommodations and identify resources on campus or in the community that might be helpful for you. Accommodations are established through an interactive process. For more information, <a href="https://ualr.edu/disability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the DRC website</a> or review the <a href="https://ualr.edu/disability/steps-for-requesting-accommodations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steps to request accommodations</a>. We want you to know you are valued, welcome, and wanted at UA Little Rock.</div>
