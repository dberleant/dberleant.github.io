        <h5>IFSC 7310, HW2, due Thursday 2/2/2023</h5>
        <p>Directions: Please answer the questions below, posting the result in a document on your website, with a link to it from your home page.
        
        <ol>
            <li>Learning resources.
                <ul>
                    <li>Consider the videoconference study & discussion group (see link in the schedule on the syllabus). Try out the link. What did you see? What is the role of HTML on this site? What about the site would HTML not be capable of implementing?</li>
                    <li>Access the Slack site for the course (see link in the schedule on the syllabus). Post a hello message on it. Give a potential<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use case</a> about you using it. A Fowler style use case would be one reasonable way to do this. If you have any questions about this, feel free to seek assistance using Slack.
                    <li>Analyze: What is the role of HTML in the Slack site? What about the site would HTML not be capable of implementing?
                </ul>
            <li>This course.
                <ul>
                    <li>How does the teaching style of this course compare to the teaching styles of the courses you have taken in the past at your previous university? Do you have any comments on that?
                    <li>Recall hW1. What about it could be improved for next year's class? What about it is good and should be kept for next year's class?
                </ul>
            <li>Bulletin boards, also known as forums, also known as message boards. See the lecture recording as needed. 
                Explain the similarities and differences associated with the bulletin board / message board / forum concept
                among three different such systems, (i) Slack, (ii) ars technica's forums (https://arstechnica.com/civis/) and (iii) phpBB.
            <li>HTML. If your HTML test/demo page from HW1 is not a separate page from the rest of your HW1 answers, make it a separate page. 
                Then add 20 more HTML command demos. Number them all.
        </ol>
