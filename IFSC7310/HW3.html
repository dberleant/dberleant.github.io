            <li>Add a form to your encyclopedia or compendium of HTML commands. The form should contain at least 20 different form components and variations of components.
              This is only a small fraction of all the variations possible. You can use your compendium as a reference in the future.
            <li>Recall hW2. What about it could be improved for next year's class? What about it is good and should be kept for next year's class?
            <li>For either the problem discussed in class as an example (000wwebhost.com), or for some system at UALR like registration or whatever it might be, or for the process
              of getting to UALR (involving travel authorizations and so on), analyze it using the root cause analysis methods discussed in class, identifying problems if any and 
              potential improvements.
