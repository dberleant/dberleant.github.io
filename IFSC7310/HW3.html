        <h5>IFSC 7310, HW3. This one is due Saturday 2/11/2023, as we experiment with different due dates</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Please answer the questions below, posting the result in a document on your website, with a link to it from your home page. 
                <li>There is normally <u>no need to send an
                    email</u> when done, because we will go to your home page to find it. If doing it late, then you should send an email reminding us to look for it again, 
                    so you get credit for doing it. 
                    <li>Do not put your name or especially your T number on the HW. The address is enough.
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add a form to your encyclopedia or compendium of HTML commands. The form should contain at least 20 different form components and variations of components.
              This is only a small fraction of all the variations possible. You can use your compendium as a reference in the future.
            <li>Recall hW2. What about it could be improved for next year's class? What about it is good and should be kept for next year's class?
            <li>For either the problem discussed in class as an example (000wwebhost.com), or for some system at UALR like registration or whatever it might be, or for the process
              of getting to UALR (involving travel authorizations and so on), analyze it using a detailed fishbone diagram. Really get into the diagram with lots of details. 
              Identify which possible causes are reasonable and which can be excluded. Use this to give some suggestions about potential improvements.
        </ol>
