  <h3>Let's discuss...</h3>
  <dl>
      <dt>Root cause analysis
            <dd>It's one of the key techniques in systems analysis!
      <dt>Context
            <dd>Where is root cause analysis within the broader systems analysis field?
      <dt>Problem
            <dd>We need an IT problem to analyze
                  <br>I nominate "000webhost.com and '<u>the IFSC 7310 web crash</u>'"
                  <br>Turn lemons into lemonade!
      <dt>The solution
            <dd>Examine root cause analysis techniques
                  <br>Choose a suitable one
                  <br>Learn and apply to the problem         
</dl>

<h3>Root cause analysis: what is it?</h3>
  <dl>
  <dt>Why?
    <dd>...because just covering up the symptoms might not be the best way
  <dt>If something hurts...
    <dd>take a painkiller pill?
    <dd>That might solve the problem
    <dd>It might *not* solve the problem
    <dd>Examples?
  <dt>Patch the problem?
    <dd>Car wheel about to fall off? 
    <dd>Wrap lots of tape around it
    <dd>No - find out why, and fix that
  <dt>Root cause analysis:
    <dd>Find the root of the problem
    <dd>That enables fixing the underlying cause
  </dl>
 
<h3>Context: The systems analysis field</h3> 
  <dl>
  <dt>Systems analysis
    <dd>Specifying and designing <u>improved organization IT processes</u>
    <dd>Improvement techniques include
  <dt>Process mapping
    <dd>visualizations of existing processes (to identify possible improvements)
  <dt>Root cause analysis
    <dd>finding underlying causes of problems (to identify what to improve)
  <dt>Benchmarking
    <dd>comparing organizational processes to other organizations' processes (to identify areas to improve)
  <dt>Prototyping
    <dd>building throwaway test solutions to decide what to build for real (to identify how to do improvements)
  <dt>Cost-benefit analysis
    <dd>comparing the benefits of a process change to its costs (to decide if improvement is worth doing)
  <dt>Automation
    <dd>using technology to boost labor productivity (to improve process quality and cost)
 	<dt>Lean Six Sigma
    <dd>a methodology for reducing process costs and increasing process quality (to improve processes)
 	<dt>User involvement
    <dd>getting user input into process spec and design (to improve the process specs and designs)
  </dl>
  
  
  <h3>Example of an IT Process Problem</h3>

  <dt>Website for this course
    <dd><a href="https://us-lti.bbcollab.com/recording/c45f3c4902904522895a6b96a5882006">A long and frustrating example of interacting with an IT system</a>
  <dt>Not fun!
    <dd>It needs improvement
    <dd>Systems analysis should shed light on things like this
    <dd>So let's systems analyze it!
  </dl>
 
  <h3>Which systems analysis techniques might work? Why?</h3> 
  <dl>
  <dt>Review of some systems analysis approaches
    <dd><u>Let us discuss the applicability of each</u>
    <dd>Suggestions: class discussion, small group discussions, or chat window
  <dt>Process mapping
    <dd>visualizations of existing processes (to identify possible improvements)
  <dt>Root cause analysis
    <dd>finding underlying causes of problems (to identify what to improve)

  <h3>Fishbone Diagrams (Ishikawa Diagrams)</h3>
  <span>They look like a fish skeleton (well, sort of)</span>
  <span>They are for understanding causes of a problem</span>
  <span>They <u>identify</u> and can <u>categorize</u> potential causes
    
  <dl>
    <dt>Shaped like a skeleton (see images)
      <dd> The fish head is for the problem
      <dd>The fish bones are for the causes
    <dt>Some steps in making fishbone diagrams
      <dd>1. Write problem at head of diagram
      <dd>2. Draw a branch from the spine for each <u>category</u> of possible causes
      <dd>3. From each branch draw branchlets, one for each possible cause
      <dd>4. From branchlets draw twigs for more specific "sub"-causes
      <dd>5. As needed, sub-twigs may also be added for even more specific causes
    <dt>Why and when to use fishbone diagrams?
      <dd>Structured, step by step approach for identifying causes
      <dd>Help to see patterns and connections within the space of possible causes
      <dd>The visualization helps communicate possible causes within and outside the group
      <dd>The point is to support improvement in the processes under consideration
    <dt>Find a useful or interesting fact about fishbone diagrams
    <dt>Let's try to apply fishbone diagrams to the problem of interest
