        <h5>IFSC 7310, HW1, due Friday 1/27/23 at 5:00 p.m.</h5>
        <p>Directions: Please answer the questions below, posting the result in a document on your website, with a link to it from your home page.
        
        <ol>
            <li>Make an account on www.000webhost.com. It is suggested to name your site something different from your own name, since it will be on the web and visible to the world. Make a home page. Email the instructor at jdberleant@ualr.edu with the URL (web address) of your home page.
                <blockquote>HINT on using the 000webhost.com file manager: 1) Save frequently. It times out after a number of minutes of not saving and any unsaved change will be irretrievably lost. It happened to me so I am writing this caution for you. If anyone observes how many minutes it takes to time out, please let me know. 2) I found myself trying to re-login to the file manager at files.000webhost.com. It claims the password is wrong. You think you must have typed it wrong or forgotten it when actually you need to login to www.000webhost.com, not files.000webhost.com. If anyone finds out how to log directly into files.000webhost.com please let me know.

            <li>A critique of a common approach to grading was presented in class, and a solution to be used in this course was described. 
                What is your conclusion? Give your opinion or conclusion, but also explain why.
            <li>Build an HTML test or demo page, which contains examples of various HTML commands. This page tests your browser to see how it handles different HTML commands and if it handles them properly. The examples should explain themselves. For example, if you demo bolding, have the demo be something like
                <br><b>The b command is for bolding</b> (this is one way to do it)
                <br>rather than something that doesn't explain it, like
                <br><b>This shows bolding, but doesn't explain anything</b> (this is not a good way to do it).
                <ul>
                    <li>Link to your test page from your HW1 document.
                    <li>Demo at least 25 things on the page.
                </ul>
            <li>Evaluate the power of HTML in social media websites. 
                <ul>
                    <li>For the social media website of your choice, what needs of this social media website does HTML meet? What needs does it not meet? Explain.
                    <li>Invent a new kind of social media. 
                        (i) What does it do? 
                        (ii) What needs of this new social media website does HTML meet? 
                        (iii) What needs does it not meet?
                </ul>
            <li>Physical exercise is well know to have various benefits. 
                We could do a 1-2 minute exercise set in the middle of class to refresh and get the blood circulating. 
                Is this a good idea, too offbeat, not sure, or what do you think? 
        </ul>
