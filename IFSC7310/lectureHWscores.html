Why Scoring Assignments 0-100 Doesn't Work
     (but scoring them 50-100 does)
==========================================


Consider two students, M and N

Both students take the same two courses

Student M gets 100s on everything in one course
               0s on everything in the other
               
Student N gets 100s on everything for 1st half of the semester
               0s on everything for the 2nd half of the semester
               
Result:
  Both students got the same number of 100s
  Both students got the same number of 0s
  Both students learned the same amount (but different things)
  But they end up with different GPAs!
               
Let's see why
-------------

We assume a typical grading method:
             A=90-100%   B=80-90%   C=70-80%   D=60-70%   F=0-60%
GPA values:    4.0         3.0        2.0        1.0        0.0   

Calculate M's GPA:
-----------------

   "A" in one course, "F" in the other
   
   GPA value of "A" is 4.0, "F" is 0.0
   
   Overall GPA is (4.0+0.0)/2 = 2.0
   

Calculate N's GPA:
-----------------

   Half 100s and half 0s in one course: 50%="F"
   Half 100s and half 0s in other course: 50%="F"
   
   GPA value of "F" is 0.0
   
   Overall GPA is (0.0+0.0)/2 = 0.0
   
   
RESULT: one student has a GPA of 2.0, the other has 0.0

To repeat,
  Both students got the same number of 100s
  Both students got the same number of 0s
  Both students learned the same amount (but different things)
  But they end up with different GPAs


Let's redo the analysis but with scoring from 50-100
                             (instead of from  0-100)
-----------------------------------------------------

Student M gets 100s on everything in one course
                50s on everything in the other
               
Student N gets 100s on everything for the 1st half of the semester
                50s on everything for the 2nd half of the semester

Again we assume the typical grading method:                 
             A=90-100%   B=80-90%   C=70-80%   D=60-70%   F=0 or 50-60%
GPA values:    4.0         3.0        2.0        1.0        0.0   

Calculate M's GPA:
-----------------

   All 100s in one course: "A"
   
   All 50s in the other course: "F"
   
   "A" in one course, "F" in the other
   
   GPA value of "A" is 4.0, "F" is 0.0
   
   Overall GPA is (4.0+0.0)/2 = 2.0
   
   (Just like before)
   

Calculate N's GPA:
-----------------

   Half 100s and half 50s in  one  course: 75%="C"
   Half 100s and half  0s in other course: 75%="C"
   
   GPA value of "C" is 2.0
   
   Overall GPA is (2.0+2.0)/2 = 2.0
   
   
RESULT: both students have the same GPA of 2.0

Now,
  Both students got the same number of 100s
  Both students got the same number of  50s
  Both students learned the same amount (but different things)
  Both students ended up with the same GPA


THEREFORE, in this course, we will use the 50-100 scale


Appendix: Graduate School Grades at UALR
========================================

  Different from undergraduate standards
  
  Must have GPA=3.0 or higher to graduate
     There are many other details
     Some students need to take extra courses if:
        GPA is above 3.0 but below 3.5
