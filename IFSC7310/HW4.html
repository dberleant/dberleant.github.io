        <h5>IFSC 7310, H43. This one is due Saturday 2/18/2023</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Please answer the questions below, posting the result in a document on your website, with a link to it from your home page. 
            <li>There is normally <u>no need to send an
                email</u> when done, because we will go to your home page to find it. <u>If doing it late, then you should send an email</u>
                reminding us to look for it again, so you get credit for doing it. 
            <li>Do not put your name or especially your T number on the HW. We can get to it from your website address, which we already have.
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Add more things to the form on your web page of HTML commands. It is becoming a kind of dictionary of HTML commands. 
                The form should contain at least 15 more things: 
                <ul>
                    <li>13 different form components and variations of components
                    <li>an action attribute in the <b>&lt;form action=yourActionHandlerGoesHere&gt;</b> tag. 
                    The action attribute and its value, the action handler, should look like: <b>action="https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php"</b>.
                    W3schools.com has similar examples that you can use for help. However the examples there specify the action attribute and value as 
                        <b>action="/action_page.php"</b> and not <b>action="https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php"</b>. 
                    Their way won't work outside of their site.
                    <li>A <b>submit</b> button (which you might potentially already have) 
                        that submits your form to w3schools's handler php program, <b>action_page.php</b>.
                 </ul>
            <li>Recall HW3. What about it could be improved for next year's class? What about it is good and should be kept for next year's class?
            <li>For some system at UALR like registration or whatever it might be, or for the process
              of getting to UALR (involving travel authorizations and so on), analyze it using FMEA 
              You probably will need to draw it by hand and take a phone cam shot of it (or use a general purpose graphics editor) 
              because most of the free tools don't support sub-sub-branches. Hint: this diagram might be useful.

              <br>Identify which possible causes are reasonable and which can be excluded. Use this to give some suggestions about potential improvements.
