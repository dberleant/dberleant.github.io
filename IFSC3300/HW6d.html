IFSC 3300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  HW6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Due by Wednesday Oct. 5, 2022</b></p>

<p>Directions: Email your assignment to IFSC3300HW@gmail.com. </p>

<!--  Update this HW to get higher scores as students scores were significantly below desired levels
  
<p>
Do question 1A or 1B.
  <p>
  1A. Make a set of buttons that demonstrate arrays! 
  <ul>
  <li>a. One of them should use a for loop to iterate through the array from element 0 to the last element. 
  <li>b. One should use the forEach() loop to iterate through the array.
  <li>c. One should demonstrate push().
  <li>d. One should demonstrate pop().
  <li>e. One should demonstrate shift().
  <li>f. One should demonstrate unshift().
  <li>g. One should demonstrate a 2D array.
  <li>h. One should demonstrate a 3D array.
  <li>i. One should demonstrate the length attribute of an array.
  <li>j. One should show how the typeof of an array is "object".
  <li>k,l,m,n,o. Five should demonstrate different things about objects.
  </ul>  
If you saved a program with buttons demonstrating things about JavaScript from a previous HW, why not combine them with this HW to build a more comprehensive page of 
buttons showing how JavaScript works! In either case, save this HW so you can add the buttons to a future HW. By the end of the course you can have 
a page with lots of buttons showing a kind of encyclopedia of JavaScript.
  <p>
    1B. Make, or improve, a simple game in Javascript. 
        It should contain array(s) and object(s). You can build on a game handed in for a previous HW. If you do that, 
        be sure to make it very clear in embedded comments what lines of code are new or changed for this assignment. 

<p>2. What are the attribute names and attribute values of the
object predefined in a web page called <b>document</b>? Use a for/in loop.</p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HINT: The following script,
<pre>
&lt;script>
alert(document);
&lt;/script>
</pre>
displays the output
<pre>
[object HTMLDocument]
</pre>
indicating that document is a predefined object. It is predefined by the web page that the code is embedded in. Since it is an object, it has parts, and those parts can be stepped through using a for/in loop.    

<p>3. Now list the attribute names and attribute values for the data structure, which is implemented as an object,
that stores some specific <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
HTML element in a web page. Every <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> element in a web page is stored by the browser,
using JavaScript, as an object. Hints: A call to document.getElementById("demo") returns the object behind
the HTML <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> element with the id "demo" if there is one. 
That object is the JavaScript entity that stores everything about 
that <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> HTML element.  
Once that object has been returned, we have an object whose parts can be stepped through using a for/in loop, 
just like the parts of the document object were stepped through in the previous question.</p>

<p>4. Optional (you don't have to do this one). Do the following object step-by-step exercise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>a) In a sandbox, declare an object <b>myObj</b>
with an attribute (property, local variable, member, member variable) called <b>name</b>.
Access the value of <b>name</b> using the syntax <b>myObj.name</b>. Also access
it using the syntax <b>myObj[&quot;name&quot;]</b>. The two attribute references
are interchangeable and so should obtain the same value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>b) Declare a variable <b>x</b> and
give it the string value <b>&quot;name&quot;</b>. Change your access to <b>myObj[&quot;name&quot;]</b>
to <b>myObj[x]</b>. The two references are to the same thing and thus are
interchangeable and so should obtain the same value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>c) Try to access <b>myObj.x</b>. It
doesn't work. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>d) Add a new attribute (property, local
variable, member, member variable) to the object, and call this new attribute <b>x</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>e) Show that <b>myObj[x]</b> provides
a different value than <b>myObj.x</b>. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>f) Add a new attribute to the
object called <b>myFunc</b>. For its value, assign to it, not a number like 3,
but a function definition, like <b>function(){return &quot;Hi!&quot;;}</b>.
This attribute is often called a &quot;method,&quot; a term referring to a
function that is in an object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>g) Print the value of <b>myFunc</b>.
It should be the function definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>h) Print the value of <b>myFunc()</b>.
It should be whatever value is returned when <b>myFunc()</b> runs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>i) Set <b>x</b> to the string value
<b>&quot;myFunc&quot;</b> as in: <b>x=&quot;myFunc&quot;;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>j) Run <b>myObj[x]()</b>. It should
do exactly the same as <b>myObj.myFunc()</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>k) Add 2 or more attributes to <b>myObj</b>.
To do this just assign a value to the new attribute and it will be created and
will hold the new value. For example, <b>myObj.newAttribute=5; </b>will give <b>myObj</b>
a new attribute called <b>newAttribute</b> and assign it the value 5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>l) Use a for/in loop to go through <b>myObj</b>
and print out each attribute and its value. An example of a for/in loop is in: <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_object_for_in">https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_object_for_in</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>j) What happens when you try to
loop through the object's parts using the dot notation, as used in <b>myObj.whatever</b>?
Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>k) Why is the square bracket
notation, as in <b>myObj[x]</b>, more powerful than the dot notation, as used in
<b>myObj.whatever</b>?</p>
