<p>Directions: Email your assignment to IFSC3300HW@gmail.com. Send the URL of a sandbox with your program.</p>

<p>
Make a set of buttons that demonstrate arrays! At least one of them should use a for loop to iterate through the array from element 0 to the last element. 
If you saved a program with buttons demonstrating things about JavaScript from a previous HW, combine them with this HW to build a more comprehensive page of 
buttons showing how JavaScript works. In either case, save this HW so you can add the buttons to a future HW. By the end of the course you can have 
a page with lots of buttons showing all kinds of different things.
