IFSC 3300&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  HW7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Due by Wednesday Oct. 13, 2021</b></p>

<p>Directions: Do either question 1 or question 2, but not both. 
  Email your assignment to IFSC3300HW@gmail.com. It is best to put the code in the body of your email.</p>

<p>
1. A. Make a set of buttons that demonstrate strings. You can combine these new buttons with the buttons of the previous HW, 
  putting the new buttons so they display above the old ones (for visibility) and building a button based JavaScriptopedia.
  Or you can start a new page of buttons.
  <p>
    B. Add more buttons demonstrating "100"/"10", "100"+"10", NaN, Infinity, and hexadecimal numbers.

2. Work string operations and number entities like NaN, Infinity and hex numbers into a game. It can be a new game or additions to a previous game. If you are
  adding to a previous game, be sure to include the date of any new line of code in a comment so you get credit for it. I am not sure how to add to a previous game,
  but maybe you could have puzzles the player solves involving strings and number entities, or whatever you can think of doing.
