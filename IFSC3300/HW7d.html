<p>
1. Make a set of buttons that demonstrate strings. Combine these new buttons with the buttons of the previous HW, putting the new buttons before the old ones (for visibility).

<p>
2. Modify 
the button
styles. Here is an example:

<button style="background-color:green;color:blue;font-size:30pt;height:40px;">My favorite button</button> (check the source code for this button to see how it is done).

<p>
3. Add a for loop, a a for...in loop, a while loop, and a do while loop. These should be activated by buttons that demonstrate the loops.
