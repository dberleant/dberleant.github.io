<p class=MsoNormal><b>HW 14 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IFSC 30003  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Due W 12/10/2025</b></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><b>Please email your answers to: IFSC30003HW@gmail.com.</b> Do not submit code as a shared document,
  because too often we run into permission problems and format conversion problems. 

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Do <a href="###">this</a> exercise on regular expressions, 
  and hand in a screenshot of the final result.
	
  <p class=MsoNormal>2. In the previous HW you improved a program by adding the use of (i) a BOM item, and (ii) cookies.
    Add even more to it, this time adding some use of regular expressions. 
	In the body of the email, hand in the key new JS statements that directly involve regular expressions
	with comments explaining how they work. As an attachment, also hand in the entire program.
	  
  <p class=MsoNormal>3. Find a small chunk of code from a web page somewhere on the web. 
	  Ask an AI (claude.ai seems to make copy pasting chat transcripts convenient currently)
	  questions about it so you learn new things, like we did in class. It will likely help if you 
	  remind the AI that you want short explanations, not a whole article in response to anything you ask.
	  You can also ask it to respond at a level of difficulty you can learn from, otherwise it might
	  respond at a too advanced (or too elementary) level to be able to learn much from.
	  When you've learned something, ask the AI to give you some multiple choice or short answer
	  questions about it. If the questions are too hard ask for hints, clarifications, simpler
	  questions, etc. 
	  <p>Hand in the transcript of your discussion with the AI, along with your opinion of the 
	     educational value of this type of use of AI from a life-long learning standpoint, including
		 something about the fact that the AI might not be, and likely is not, 100% correct in its responses.
