4. Consider W3school's
page on <span class=colorh1><span style='color:windowtext'><a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_win_localstorage.asp">JS support for
local storage</a>. It has a "Try it Yourself" sandbox that has code you can
modify for this problem if you like. </span></span></p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph><span style='font-size:7.0pt'>
a) Create a
variable called myObj and define it to have an address attribute and, as
its value, some string like "33 Main St., Little Rock" or whatever you like.
<br>
b) Modify the setItem() call to be setItem("JSONstring",
_______) where
the underlined portion contains a call to stringify myObj. This will store your object as
JSON text in the brower's hidden local storage area in a virtual file called JSONstring
<br>
c)Print the
value of the stringified myObj so you can see what it looks
like.
<br>
d) Modify the getItem() call and add any code necessary
to retrieve the JSON text, parse it back into an object, and print the address.
<br>
<br>
Note to instructor: another possible cookies problem to consider for
future use is: Â Type into
a form and save into cookies, using the example I gave for processing a form in
its own web page. </span></p>
