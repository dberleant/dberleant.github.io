<p class=MsoNormal>Directions: Please provide the code for all questions that
involve coding. Answers should be included in the body (instead of as
attachments) of an email. Answers can be links to sandboxes as appropriate.

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoListParagraph style='margin-left:36.75pt;text-indent:-18.75pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
the following object exercises.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>a) In a sandbox, declare an object <b>myObj</b>
with an attribute (property, local variable, member, member variable) called <b>name</b>.
Access the value of <b>name</b> using the syntax <b>myObj.name</b>. Also access
it using the syntax <b>myObj[&quot;name&quot;]</b>. The two attribute references
are interchangeable and so should obtain the same value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>b) Declare a variable <b>x</b> and
give it the string value <b>&quot;name&quot;</b>. Change your access to <b>myObj[&quot;name&quot;]</b>
to <b>myObj[x]</b>. The two references are to the same thing and thus are
interchangeable and so should obtain the same value.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>c) Try to access <b>myObj.x</b>. It
doesn't work. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>d) Add a new attribute (property, local
variable, member, member variable) to the object, and call this new attribute <b>x</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>e) Show that <b>myObj[x]</b> provides
a different value than <b>myObj.x</b>. Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>f) Add a new attribute to the
object called <b>myFunc</b>. For its value, assign to it, not a number like 3,
but a function definition, like <b>function(){return &quot;Hi!&quot;;}</b>.
This attribute is often called a &quot;method,&quot; a term referring to a
function that is in an object. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>g) Print the value of <b>myFunc</b>.
It should be the function definition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>h) Print the value of <b>myFunc()</b>.
It should be whatever value is returned when <b>myFunc()</b> runs.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>i) Set <b>x</b> to the string value
<b>&quot;myFunc&quot;</b> as in: <b>x=&quot;myFunc&quot;;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>j) Run <b>myObj[x]()</b>. It should
do exactly the same as <b>myObj.myFunc()</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>k) Add 2 or more attributes to <b>myObj</b>.
To do this just assign a value to the new attribute and it will be created and
will hold the new value. For example, <b>myObj.newAttribute=5; </b>will give <b>myObj</b>
a new attribute called <b>newAttribute</b> and assign it the value 5.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>l) Use a for/in loop to go through <b>myObj</b>
and print out each attribute and its value. An example of a for/in loop is in: <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_object_for_in">https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_object_for_in</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>j) What happens when you try to
loop through the object's parts using the dot notation, as used in <b>myObj.whatever</b>?
Why?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in'>k) Why is the square bracket
notation, as in <b>myObj[x]</b>, more powerful than the dot notation, as used in
<b>myObj.whatever</b>?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. What are the attribute names and attribute values of the
object predefined in a web page called <b>document</b>? Use a for/in loop.</p>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HINT: The following script,
<pre>
&lt;script>
alert(document);
&lt;/script>
</pre>
displays the output
<pre>
[object HTMLDocument]
</pre>
indicating that document is a predefined object. It is predefined by the web page that the code is embedded in. Since it is an object, it has parts, and those parts can be stepped through using a for/in loop.    

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Now list the attribute names and attribute values for a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>
HTML element in a web page. Hints: We know from the previous question that document is an object and thus has internal parts. One of those parts is the getElementById() method. A call to document.getElementById('demo') runs that method, which runs and returns an object. That object is the JavaScript entity that stores everything about a <b>&lt;p&gt;</b> HTML element with id 'demo' (if one exists, as it does for example in the sandbox at https://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_myfirst). Once that paragraph's object has been returned, we have an object whose parts can be stepped through using a for/in loop, just like the parts of the document object were stepped through in the previous question.</p>
