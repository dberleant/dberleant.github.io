<p class=MsoNormal>Directions: Please provide the code for all questions that
involve coding.

<p class=MsoListParagraph>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>1. Work with the game at http://dberleant.github.io/IFSC3300/HW6c-conditionalsBubbleGame.html. 
    Get a good score. Hand in a screen shot showing the score.

  <p>2. Work with the system at https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/b1ab4211-a5c7-4986-9d6f-46d470626d36. 
    Hand in a screen shot showing the final score. 

  <p>3. Make a web page with buttons. Have a different button that demonstrates each of the following: 
    if statement, if else statement, else if construct, 
    do...while loop, while loop, for loop, and the conditional operator ("___?___:___").
    Develop it using a sandbox. Avoid using AI except for emergency hints, if you want to
    learn anything. Hand in the code of the web page.

  <p>4. Update the buttons to be in a different color (or colors) and/or font. 
    Use an AI for info on how to do it, but make th changes yourself.
    Hand in a screen shot.

  <p>5. Take a program that you used AI to write in an earlier HW. 
    Using AI, make modifications to it and check them. Explain how it went. 

  <p>6. A function can be a convenient unit of code that does a know thing to its inputs,
    produces an output, and as long as you trust it, you can then use it, ignoring what goes on inside the
    function. Using AI, create a function that takes four input arguments and returns something.
    Test it yourself in a sandbox. Explain how you tested it and if it had any bugs. Hand in the function,
    description of your testing process, and if you can trust it or not.
    
  <p>7. (Don't do this one this semester) Consider the early text-based computer game "Adventure." 
    See <a href="http://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=2020">https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=2020</a>. 
    I used to play it, a long time ago. 
    A video that is at least very short, if not perfect, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TkV9y15XRw">here</a>. 
    If you find a better video please email me to let me know.
    I found a free online version at <a href="https://grack.com/demos/adventure/">grack.com/demos/adventure</a> 
      (caution: I didn't test it in detail, but it appears to work).
    To give a hint, it started by saying I was near a building, so I typed "in building" and it moved me into the building. 
    Then it said there were some keys and things on the floor. 
    So, I typed "take keys." It responded with "ok." 
    And so on - you can probably sort of see where this is going.
    <p>
      Make a rather simple game in Javascript. Don't worry, 
      it doesn't have to be the next blockbuster on STEAM! 
      (But we had a student who did design a blockbuster on STEAM.)
      Use looping and conditional statements as needed.
