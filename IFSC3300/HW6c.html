  Do option A or option B.
  
  <p> <b>Option A: buttons</b>
  
<p>A1. Conditionals.
  <ul>
    <li> a. Declare and assign a value to <b>x</b>. If <b>x</b> is 3, print "x === 3".
    <li> b. Add an else clause. It prints "x===4".
    <li> c. Alas, your program has a bug: if x is 5 it still prints "x === 4"! 
      Fix the bug with an "else if" construct, so that now, 
      if x is 4 it correctly prints "x===4" but on the other hand if x is not 4
      it correctly prints "x != 4".
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    A2. a. Demonstrate the if statement using a button.<br>
       b. Demonstrate the if else statement using a button.<br>
       c. Demonstrate the "else if" statement (an if else statement in which the else clause is another if else statement) using a button.
  
  <p>
A3. Implement a for loop, a while loop, and a do while loop. These should involve buttons that demonstrate the loops.
    
    <p>
A4. Modify 
the button
styles. Here is an example:

<button style="background-color:green;color:blue;font-size:30pt;height:50pt;">My favorite button</button> (check the source code for this button to see how it is done).

  <p><b>Option B: Game</b>
    
    <p> Consider the early text-based computer game "Adventure." 
    See <a href="www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=2020">https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=2020</a>. I used to play it, a long time ago. 
    A video that is at least very short, if not perfect, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TkV9y15XRw">here</a>. 
    If you find a better video please email me to let me know.
    For Fall 2022 I found a free online version at <a href="https://grack.com/demos/adventure/">grack.com/demos/adventure</a> (caution: I didn't test it in detail).
    To give a hint, it started by saying I was near a building, so I typed "in building" and it moved me into the building. 
    Then it said there were some keys and things on the floor. 
    So, I typed "take keys." It responded with "ok." 
    And so on - you can probably sort of see where this is going.
    <p>
      Make a simple game in Javascript. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be the next blockbuster on STEAM! (But we had a student who did design a blockbuster on STEAM.)
