<p>1. Conditionals.
  <ul>
    <li> a. Declare and assign a value to <b>x</b>. If <b>x</b> is 3, print "x === 3".
    <li> b. Add an else clause. It prints "x===4".
    <li> c. Alas, your program has a bug: if x is 5 it still prints "x === 4"! 
      Fix the bug with an "else if" construct, so that now, 
      if x is 4 it correctly prints "x===4" but on the other hand if x is not 4
      it correctly prints "x != 4".
  </ul>
  
  <p>
2. Implement a for loop, a while loop, and a do while loop. These should be activated by buttons that demonstrate the loops.
