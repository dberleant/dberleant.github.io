1. Recall <button style="background-color:#FC9630;color:blue;font-size:30pt;height:60px;">My favorite button</button>, 
	which is like a button in a previous HW except the background color is different this time and, more importantly, 
	the way the color is specified is different: 
	instead of having <b>background-color:green</b> it has <b>background-color:#FC9630</b> 
	(check the source code for this page for more details on the button). 
	This uses the RGB (red-green-blue) color specification method.
	The six hexadecimal digits FC9630 indicate FC for the amount of red, 96 for the amount of green, 
	and 30 for the amount of blue; FC is a lot of red, almost FF which is the maximum 2-digit hexadecimal 
	(specifically, FC=FF-3, or in base 10, 252=255-3). 
	Red and green, if they were in approximately equal amounts, would give yellow. However in this case there is 
	less green (96 out of the maximum possible FF in hexadecimal, which is the same as 150 out of 255 in decimal numbers), which
	moves the color to between yellow and red, or orange. The amount of blue mixed in, 
	30 out of FF (hex) = 48 out of 255 (decimal), is so small that it doesn't affect the orange that much. 
	It makes the orange color a little lighter since all colors together combine to make white, 
	so now we have orange with a little white (48 units of blue, combining with 48 units of the 252 units of red, 
	and 48 of the 150 units of green to make a bit of white) mixed in with the orange. 
	48 out of a possible 255 isn't that much, and if it wasn't mixed in with the orange, 
	48 alone of the three colors, mixed together, would be a dark gray
	(that is, between white and black but closer to black, 
	where a pure black is color 000000 and a maximally bright white is FFFFFF).
<p>     Explain why 
	<span style="font-size: 0px; color: transparent;">noting briefly that the sky is orange</span>
	the above button is bright orange.
<p>2.	We discussed time and date in class. Do the "Time Traveler" game at 
	https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/c5b75b03-fc06-41ef-9b7e-e4aadbf06f54
	and hand in a screen shot at the end or however far you can get.
	
<br><p> 3. In the previous HW, you improved a program that you had been working on by adding colors to it. 
	This time, improve it so that it uses time and/or date functionality. Find an improvement the AI can do successfully,
	and also an improvement it can't. (Naturally, keep plenty of backups so you can always go back to something that works
	when the AI messes things up.) Hand in a working program, 
	along with an explanation of what the AI could do, what it couldn't,
	and your explanation of why.
	
	
<br><p> 4. Demonstrate a bunch of events. Use buttons or a game, or any other way (most of the events work just as well with other HTML 
	elements like &lt;p>, &lt;span>, &lt;h1>...&lt;h6>, etc. as they do with buttons). 
	Explain what you did.
