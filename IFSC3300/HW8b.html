1. Recall <button style="background-color:#fc9630;color:blue;font-size:30pt;height:40px;">My favorite button</button>, except the color is different this time and, more importantly, the way the color is specified is different: instead of having <b>background-color:green</b> it has <b>background-color:#fc9630</b> (check the source code for this page for more details on the button). This uses the RGB (red-green-blue) color specification method. The six hexadecimal digits fc9630 indicate fc for the amount of red, 96 for the amount of green, and 30 for the amount of blue. fc is a lot of red, almost ff which is the maximum 2-digit hexadecimal (specifically,fc=ff-3, or in base 10, 252=255-3). Red and green in approximately equal amounts gives yellow. Less green (in this case, 96 out of ff in hexadecimal, or 150 out of 255 in decimal numbers) moves the color to between yellow and red, or orange. The amount of blue mixed in, 30 out of ff (hex) = 48 out of 255 (decimal), is so small that it doesn't affect the orange that much. It makes the orange color a little lighter since all colors together combine to make white, so now we have orange with a little (48 units of blue, combining with 48 units of the 252 units of red, and 48 of the 150 units of green to make a bit of white) mixed in with the orange. 48 out of a possible 255 isn't that much, and if it wasn't mixed in with the orange, 48 alone of the three colors, mixed together, would be a dark gray (that is, between white and black but closer to black, where a pure black is color 000000 and a maximally bright white is ffffff).

Make a simple button-based game that helps people (like you) practice and learn about hexadecimals and/or colors. Feel free to add it to other set(s) of buttons you did for earlier HWs if you like.

<br><p>2. Demonstrate a bunch of events. You can do it with buttons but you don't have to: most of the events work just as well with other HTML elements like &lt;p>, &lt;span>, &lt;h1>...&lt;h6>, etc.

<br><p>3. a. Exercise 1 in HTML Forms. Give what you typed in, or a screen shot.</p>

<p>   b. Exercise 2 in HTML
Forms.</p>

<p>   c. Exercise 3 in HTML
Forms.</p>

<p>   d. Exercise 1 in HTML
Form Elements.</p>

<p>   e. Exercise 2 in HTML
