<p class=MsoNormal><b>HW 13 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; IFSC 30003  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;    Due W 12/3/2025</b></p>

  <p class=MsoNormal><b>Please email your answers to: IFSC30003HW@gmail.com.</b> Do not submit code as a shared document,
  because too often we run into permission problems and format conversion problems. 
    Instead, put it in the body of the email or, if you feel strongly about it, as an attachment.</p>
  <p>&Nopf;OTE: Qs 1-6 are fairly quick. Q7 is longer, so budget your time accordingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Do <a href="https://dberleant.github.io/IFSC3300/HW12b-BOMquiz.html">this</a>, 
  and hand in a screenshot of the the final result.

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Using a sandbox, provide the values provided by your computer for: 
  window.innerHeight, screen.height, window.screen.height (same), screen.availHeight, 
  window.location.href, location.href (same), and navigator.cookieEnabled. Also provide a
  screenshot for one of these.

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Vocabulary can make you smarter, and college is supposed to make you smarter! Recalling the class
  discussion, a taxonomy is an organized way to put things into categories. The word comes from
  its use to describe living things. So for example the animal kingdom has mammals and reptiles (and fish, and ...).
  Mammals have rodents which have mice and rats. Mammals also have cats and dogs (and people), basically any living thing
  where the babies drink milk. A partonomy is a tree showing the parts of something. So a car has wheels and and engine and ...,
  and a wheel has a tire and a rim, and a tire has a sidewall and tread, and so on. Also, an amateur is someone who likes to do something but is not a professional at it (an amateur mechanic, an 
  amateur interior decorator who gives good advice to friends but just for fun, etc.). Being an amateur is a positive, but being
  amateurish is a bit negative, suggesting low quality of work. An amateur might actually be pretty good about doing high quality
  work. Let's not even get started on the word "model".... Why is https://dberleant.github.io/IFSC3300/BOM.png
  a partonomy? 
  
  <p class=MsoNormal>4. Test out the cookie demo shown in class. Make and delete cookies. Try a different date format, since 
    JavaScript can often handle different formats. What did you try and did it work? Explain. Also explain the bakeIt() function
    in the page source code.

  <p class=MsoNormal>5. In the previous HW you improved a program by adding animation to it. 
    This time, improve it some more by adding the use of (i) a BOM item, and (ii) cookies.
    Explain the experience, and how the BOM and cookie functionalities work.
    Also hand in the code.
