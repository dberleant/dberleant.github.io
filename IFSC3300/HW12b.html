<p class=MsoNormal>1. Does <b>window.document.getElementById()</b> do the same
thing as <b>document.getElementById()</b>? Why or why not?
You can try this out in a sandbox without buttons, or you could make two buttons, one for running each of the two code snippets. 
If you do it with buttons, feel free to add them to a collection of buttons from previous assignments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Does <b>window.innerHeight</b> have the same value as <b>screen.height</b>?
Why or why not? You can try this in a sandbox without buttons, or use buttons. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. Does <b>screen.height</b> have the same value as <b>screen.availHeight</b>?
Why or why not? You can try this in a sandbox without buttons, or use buttons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. Get the <b>window.location.href</b> property. Does the
result make sense? You can try this in a sandbox without buttons, or use buttons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>5. Does your browser have cookies enabled? (Try navigator.cookieEnabled).
We will discuss cookies more next time. You can try this in a sandbox without a button, or use buttons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>6. Does <b>window.alert(“Hi!”);</b> do the same thing as <b>alert(“Hi!”);</b>
? Why or why not? You can try this in a sandbox without buttons, or use buttons.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>7. Recall the DOM. Write a script that has buttons for moving around in the DOM tree. 
Different buttons could access childNode, parentNode, nextSibling, etc. 
It could print out nodeName, nodeType, nodeValue, etc. 
Feel free to add the buttons to a collection of buttons from earlier assignments for easy future reference
