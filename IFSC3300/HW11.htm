<p class=MsoNormal>Directions: 
  The sandbox saving function in W3schools has changed and now requires you to create an account. 
  If you do that you can still send a sandbox link to <a href="mailto:ifsc3300hw@gmail.com">ifsc3300hw@gmail.com</a>.
  The link you send should have the format 
  <br>
  https://<b>mysubmdomain</b>.w3spaces.com/<b>myfilename</b>.html
  <br>
  (<b>mysubdomain</b> is where w3schools is storing your sandboxes, 
  and <b>myfilename</b> is the name you save the sandbox as). That way we can access it, while some other links people have sent in don't provide access. My sense is that 
  this new w3schools sandbox saving feature is not mature yet and will be changing over time, but that's where it is currently.
  <p>  
  However, if you prefer, just send the code in the body of your email instead (and then you don't have to make an account).

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Make a form that contains a bunch of different
features described in the W3schools lessons<span style='color:black'>&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form Elements</span></a>, &nbsp;<a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form input types</span></a>, and <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form attributes</span></a></span>. Each feature should
have a label explaining what it does. Make your action handler be <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php">https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php</a>
and be sure the form has a "submit" input type. Add this to an existing
page with other buttons already there to demonstrate things from earlier HW(s), 
or make a new page if you prefer.</p>
  
<p>Note: saved sandboxes do not run form action handlers properly because the path name of the action handler 
differs from the path of the saved sandbox area of the site.
However if you paste the saved code into a regular w3schools sandbox that they provide in the lessons, 
it should then work fine. 
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>2. Make a small game or demo in which you use setTimeOut() and/or
clearTimeOut() along with buttons, showing how these work. 
Add it to your buttons page.</p>
