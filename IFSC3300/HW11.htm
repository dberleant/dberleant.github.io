<p class=MsoNormal>Directions: Send your HW in an email to IFSC30003HW@gmail.com.
<hr>
<p class=MsoNormal>1. Review the attributes of &lt;input type="text" ...> on w3schools.com. 
  They are sprinkled through https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp. 
  You can search the page for the string <b>input type="text"</b> to find them.
  Then do the self-test quizz/game/whatever it is(?) at 
  <a href="HW11-exercise.htm">https://dberleant.github.io/IFSC3300/HW11-exercise.htm</a>. 
  
   <p class=MsoNormal>2. Using AI, make a <u>simple</u> game in JavaScript in a web page. 
     Ask it to be sure to use setInterval() and/or clearInterval() in the game.
     Consider having the game involve the player in JavaScript facts (this is optional).
     Go into the source code and explain how it uses each instance of setInterval() and clearInterval().
     Try to figure it out, then if you still have questions, you can ask the AI to help. 
     However your answer should be in your own words if you want to learn something.
     Hand in your answer and the code.
     
  
  <p class=MsoNormal>3. In the previous HW you improved a program by adding a form to it. 
    For this HW, improve it some more by adding a use of setTimeout().
    Explain the experience and, if you used AI, discuss the limitations of AI. 
    After your explanation, also hand in the code.
