<p class=MsoNormal>Directions: 
  The sandbox saving function in W3schools has changed and now requires you to create an account. 
  If you do that you can still send a sandbox link to <a href="mailto:ifsc3300hw@gmail.com">ifsc3300hw@gmail.com</a>.
  However, if you prefer, just send the code in the body of your email instead (and then you don't have to make an account).

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Make a form that contains a bunch of different
features described in the W3schools lessons<span style='color:black'>&nbsp;<a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form Elements</span></a>, &nbsp;<a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form input types</span></a>, and <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_attributes.asp"><span
style='color:purple'>Form attributes</span></a></span>. Each feature should
have a label explaining what it does. Make your action handler be <a
href="https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php">https://www.w3schools.com/action_page.php</a>
and be sure the form has a "submit" input type. Add this to an existing
page with other buttons already there to demonstrate things from earlier HW(s), 
or make a new page if you prefer.</p>
  
<p>Note: saved sandboxes do not run form action handlers properly because the path name of the action handler 
differs from the path of the saved sandbox area of the site.
However if you paste the saved code into a regular w3schools-provided sandbox it should then work fine. 
But how to you get the code? 
As of 11/3/21 the saved code does not appear in a sandbox but just as a web page.
To get the code, right click on the page and choose "View page source" (or the equivalent in your browser).
</p>


<p class=MsoNormal>2. Make a small game or demo in which you use setTimeOut() and/or
clearTimeOut() along with buttons, showing how these work. 
Add it to your buttons page.</p>
