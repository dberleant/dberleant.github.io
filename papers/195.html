<BLOCKQUOTE><I> <p align=justify> The World Wide Web is perhaps the
most convenient library resource ever to exist. Yet it also suffers
from a critical flaw: WWW document citations existing as clickable
links and as standard references in printed documents are quite
unreliable.  This arises from the ease with which these documents may
be altered. Alteration of cited WWW documents may lead to the
citations themselves becoming invalid or inaccurate. Printed documents
are less prone to such problems due to the greater difficulty in
altering or eradicating them.  As a consequence of the alterability of
WWW documents, the whole traditional system of new work building upon
an archive of unchangeable previous work ceases to be valid.  For the
first time in history, documents are being built upon a shifting
foundation to an extent of ever increasing and serious proportions.
This work investigates a system aimed at encouraging the stability of
WWW documents. In doing so it helps to preserve the accuracy of
citations over time. The system presented extends a document's URI
(Universal Resource Identifier) to include date or revision
information thus allowing document providers to permit users to refer
accurately to a particular document version. This paper both describes
the system and demonstrates its use.  The system is implemented as an
Apache WWW server module. The module processes and retrieves documents
referenced with extended URIs. It provides a model public domain
system for alleviating the problem of content stable WWW documents.

<a name=section1>
<H2>1. Introduction</H2>


<p align=justify> Documents on the WWW often undergo changes.  A
reference to a WWW document can cease to be valid when the document
is altered. Though much improved, the document may no longer
contain the information for which the reference was intended. The
problem is further compounded when the URIs of referenced documents are
changed. 

<p align=justify> A growing body of work has addressed the alterability
of links, underscoring increasing perception of the significance of the
problem.  A smaller but equally important body of work has started to
address the importance of content permanence of documents on the
WWW. The work described herein focuses on content permanence. To put our
work in context, however, the alterability of URIs is briefly discussed
next.

<p align=justify> One typical example of the need to alter a URI is when
an individual changes affiliation. URIs pointing to the individual's web
page must be changed to point to his or her new location on the
internet.  Clearly, it would be a step in the right direction to have
virtual location identifiers that don't change. An efficient way to do
this is to have a logical URI or URL which is an alias of another
physical URI, and automatically forwards (or "redirects") requests to
the physical URI. </a> <a name=backref1></a><a name=backref2>  </a> <a name=backref3>
The term<b> PURL</b> (<b>P</b>ermanent <b>URL</b>) [</a><a href=#ref1>1</a>,
<a href=#ref2>2</a>, <a href=#ref3>3</a>] is being used for such a
logical URI. A PURL can be deactivated ("turned off"), causing the PURL
server to return history and administrative information in place of the
contents of the physical URI.

<p align=justify> PURLs are intended as a stopgap until such time as
Uniform Resource Names (URNs) become established. A URN is intended to
be a permanent name for a unique resource, where a resource might be a
document (our concern here) or some other resource. This is analogous
to the use of International Standard Book Numbers (ISBNs).  URLs on
the other hand specify the locations for these unique resources.  A
given resource might be lost and no longer accessible via any URL, or
it might be available at one or several different URLs.  <a
name=backref4> </a> <a name=backref5> [</a><a href=#ref4>4</a>, <a
href=#ref5>5</a>] describe the means by which a name server takes a 
URN as input, and returns a URL at which the resource may be found (if
there is one).  <a name=backref6></a><a name=backref7>URNs are currently
undergoing specification by the URN Working Group [</a><a
href=#ref6>6</a>] of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [<a
href=#ref7>7</a>].

<p align=justify> Although PURLs and URNs help to address the permanence
of a document's unique identifier, they do not address the problem of
document content permanence. Archiving is one means of achieving content
permanence. While it is useful to be able to archive documents, it is
often necessary to change them as well.  The way to have both permanence
and changeability is by archiving one version and creating another.

<p align=justify> <a name=backref8> One approach to archiving
of WWW information is to ensure the existence of "snapshots" of the WWW,
each stored as a permanent record of the information on the WWW at a
particular point in time[</a><a href=#ref8>8</a>]. <a name=backref9> This is
currently being done by the Internet Archive organization 
[</a><a href=#ref9>9</a>]. Despite what at first glance seems a daunting
task, downloading and storing a copy of every accessible document on the
WWW is technically quite doable. Kahle [<a href=#ref8>8</a>] estimates
the memory requirement at a relatively modest 1.5&#160;terabytes as of
mid-1997, doubling yearly.  He proposes yearly followup snapshots
containing only material which has changed since the last snapshot.

<p align=justify> Other methods of archiving have begun to center more
on the use of revision control systems via the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP).  Versioning is sufficiently important in a practical
sense that versioning tools are widely available. <a name=backref10> </a> <a
name=backref11> For example <i>rcs</i> (<i>r</i>evision <i>c</i>ontrol
<i>s</i>ystem) is one of a few UNIX utilities for versioning [</a><a
href=#ref10>10</a>, <a href=#ref11>11</a>]. Because of the importance of
versioning to such areas as electronic commerce and record retrieval for
patent, legal, and medical cases, versioning systems will need to become
tamper-proof. Such uses of revision control systems may require
documents to be processed through a secure hashing scheme that gives
special codes that are unique to each version of a document and its
associated creation date.  <a name=backref12>Any modification to the
document or claim that it was created at a different time implies a code
different from the valid one [</a><a href=#ref12>12</a>].  <a
name=backref13></a><a name=backref14></a><a name=backref15>  </a> <a
name=backref16>This scheme is being applied commercially [</a><a
href=#ref13>13</a>, <a href=#ref14>14</a>] as well as to the documents
in a digital library of scholarly materials [<a href=#ref15>15</a>, <a
href=#ref16>16</a>].

<p align=justify> Versioning concepts can apply not only to individual
documents but also to sets of documents that are interconnected by
hyperlinks. Thus a version may refer to a particular state of a
document, or it may refer to the state of a set of interconnected
documents. <a name=backref17> This concept can be used in distributed
authoring of hypertext documents [</a><a href=#ref17>17</a>]. <a
name=backref18>In fact, a working group of the IETF is devoted to such
distributed authoring and versioning [</a><a href=#ref18>18</a>].

<p align=justify> The use of revision control systems has found its way
into a number of works dealing with versioning across the WWW.  <a
name=backref19> Vitali and Durand [</a><a href=#ref19>19</a>] describe a
method of encoding multiple versions (indeed an entire tree of diverging
versions) in one file which contains HTML markup tags as well as a set
of specially designed versioning tags. The file suffix for such
versioned documents is "vtml."  To request a given version, the user
provides a request like <i>
http://www.your-business.com/Research/MPP/whitepaper.vtml/2.2.3 </i>
which specifies version 2.2.3 of the vtml format document
<i>whitepaper.vtml</i>. The server must know how to extract version
2.2.3 from <i>whitepaper.vtml</i> by interpreting the version tagged
text chunks appearing in it. Furthermore, special editor features for
properly handling version tags must be used to do any updates to the
document since the version tagging operations are too complex to be done
reliably by hand. Their system is aimed at assisting in collaborative
work across the WWW by implementing a prototype WWW server based
revision control system.  Their approach requires a fairly complex vtml
editor, and also a vtml parser that must be run by the server.  
<a name=backref20> Mortice Kern Systems offers an analogous system,
Integrity Engine, in commercial form which is also intended to assist in
collaborative work across the WWW by implementing a fairly complete WWW
revision control system [</a><a href=#ref20>20</a>]. These works focus not
so much on the issue of WWW document content permanence but on collaborative
work through the WWW using revision control. The focus of this paper
is on content permanence although the work to be presented in
the following sections could be extended in the future to support
collaborative work.

<p align=justify> <a name=backref21> A work more closely related to this
paper's focus, hyperlinks to stable ("permanent") content, is that of
Pettengill [</a><a href=#ref21>21</a>]. Pettengill created a Common Gateway
Interface (CGI) program to handle the retrieval of documents under
revision control. His purpose was to capture the history of a
project or topic through its revisions.  CGI based systems such as
Pettengill's have the drawback that the document citation is tied to
the URI of the CGI program. In addition it can, as a consequence of
system calls to the CGI program, require more system processing power
than a compiled server component. Depending on the server, output may
receive no further processing thus requiring the CGI program to handle
such extras as Server Side Includes (SSI). 

<p align=justify> This paper describes a system we have implemented that
uses the concept of version and date extended URIs to encourage content
stability in references to WWW documents. <a name=backref22>The system is
implemented as a module for the Apache WWW server
[</a><a href=#ref22>22</a>]. This content permanence module, as a
consequence of being part of the server, removes the problems previously
mentioned with regards to CGI programs. It should be noted, however,
that programming errors that are part of a server can have greater
repercussions than those in a CGI program.

<p align=justify> In <a href=#section2>Section&#160;2</a> of this paper,
we will discuss the concept of content permanence relating it to the
system we have developed to handle this problem. 
<a href=#section3>Section&#160;3</a> presents the syntax of date and
version extended URIs which are a necessary part of the whole
system. Along with this section are given indications of when a date
extended URI might be used over a version extended URI and vice
versa. The actual implementation through an Apache module is described
in <a href=#section4>Section&#160;4</a>.  
<a href=#section5>Section&#160;5</a> summarizes our work and briefly
mentions future extensions.



























































































<a name=section2>
<H2>2. URI Content Permanence</H2> 

<p align=justify> Because the content of a WWW document can be updated
at any time, the stability of the content of the document is
undependable. Consequently it is difficult to use such a source as a
reliable reference due to the changeability of its content. A
technical solution is needed to keep the content referenced by a link
the same even when the corresponding document needs to be updated.
This can be done by retaining revisions of the document and
referencing the appropriate one. The solution proposed here involves
extending URIs to include date or version information, which the
server uses to obtain the appropriate revision of a document. (The
syntax for the extended URI is described in </a> <a
href=#section3>Section&#160;3</a>.) Hypermedia authors can use this
capability to ensure that links in their authored documents continue
to refer over time to the same content that they originally referred
to.  Thus authors who refer to WWW documents could rely on the
permanence of the contents of those documents similarly to how they
would rely on the permanence of the contents of printed documents.

<p align=justify> In our system, the client requests a URI augmented
with a suffix that is a date or version description, and the server
provides the appropriate version of the requested resource. The server
does this by extracting the requested version from a file containing the
document and its revision history. In this system the WWW document
provider must store documents using the RCS revision control system. In
conjunction the Apache server must be configured to use the new module
described in this paper. 

<p align=justify> The source code for the content permanence
functionality is currently being drawn directly from the Unix
<tt>rcs</tt> command <i>co</i> (<i><u>c</u></i>heck
<i><u>o</u></i>ut)[<a href=#ref11>11</a>]. This functionality has been
added to the Apache WWW server as a special Apache "module," per the
Apache Applications Program Interface (API).

<p align=justify> Our design falls squarely in the category of
<i>distributed</i> version maintenance systems. Every site wishing to
have support for links to permanent content must run a server that
supports version retrieval. <i>Centralized</i> version maintenance would
also be possible. Under a centralized approach, a site might contract
with an external version maintenance service to archive the various
revisions of their resources and make them available over the WWW. This
would reduce the possibility of document providers altering
preexisting document versions.  

<p align=justify> In both the distributed system and the centralized
system the server is altered to provide the particular version of
interest to a requesting client.  Alternatively the server could provide
the entire contents of the RCS file letting the client extract the
desired version. This method would use a WWW client plugin that
understands either RCS files or some other format such as non-standard
HTML tags that denote version-specific information, as in [<a
href=#ref19>19</a>]. Two major disadvantages of the client approach
compared to our server approach are (1) the WWW contains more installed
clients than servers, so a server-based solution such as ours has a
wider impact per installation, and (2) the client approach implies that
the proper version is extracted <i>after</i> transmission of all
versions over the web, leading to higher network traffic and slower
response times compared to a server approach such as we describe here.

<p align=justify> Another design issue concerns security. Should
archived versions be authenticated in some way? If not, archived
versions could be surreptitiously changed. An authentication system such
as that sold by Surety [<a href=#ref13>13</a>] could be integrated
into a version archiving solution to alleviate this type of problem.

<p align=justify> Each of the above mentioned approaches uses extended
URIs that contain date or version specifications.  We define the syntax
for these extended URIs in the following section.
<a name=section3>
<H2>3. Date and Version Extended URIs</H2>

<p align=justify> Since our system supports URIs augmented with date
or version specifications, it is important to describe the syntax and
semantics of these augmentations.

<p align=justify> In order to augment URIs with revision information,
each actual version must have some unique version designation. Version
information can be specified by actual version number or by a date.  To
make sense of URIs augmented with a date specification, there must be a
mechanism at the server for translating the date specification into the
proper version number. The version number received is the most recent
version saved prior to the date specified. This implies that many date
specifications may map to one version.

<p align=justify> Since HTTP GET requests by the client must contain a
version or date specification in our system, a mechanism for this is
necessary.  One possibility is through a new HTTP request-header field.
Link specifications in an HTML document could include the information,
the client could use that information in the link (when it is provided)
and put it in the HTTP request-header field, and finally the server
could use the new request-header field to help in extracting the proper
version to serve. Alternatively the URI can be extended to include the
date or version desired. This eliminates the need for an additional
request-header field. The server then simply parses out that information
from the URI and uses it to extract the proper version.  We have
established a scheme for this, as follows.

<p align=justify> First, to ensure backward compatibility, we specify
appropriate handling of a request for a URI having no appended version
or date spec.  Such a request would return either the most recent
version in the case of multiple versions or the only available version
in the case of a single version.  A request of this type is depicted in </a> 
<a href=#figure1>Figure&#160;1</a>.

<IMG align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src="current.jpg" alt="Image of request for most current version." width="557" height="332">
</table>
</center>



<p align=justify> We specify that appending a <i>colon</i> (":") to a
URI causes the server to serve a listing of all versions and their
associated dates. This of course requires the server to respect the ":"
as a reserved character in the syntax of URIs with version or date
specifications. The results of such a request are shown in </a> 
<a href=#figure2>Figure&#160;2</a>, which contains a list of clickable
version links. This is useful when referring to all versions or when
uncertain as to which version to reference.

<IMG align=right hspace=10 vspace=10 src="listing.jpg" alt="Image of request for reversion listing." width="557" height="332">
</table>
</center>



<p align=justify> A version number following a ":" causes the server to
serve the specified version. An example is provided in </a> 
<a href=#figure3>Figure&#160;3</a>. A 
document discussing the revision history of another document could
benefit from this syntax.  Links referring to a particular
version of source code would be another case in which this syntax
might be useful.

</table>
</center>





<p align=justify> We specify that appending a date spec to the URI
causes the server to serve the version that was current as of that
date. This would be the most recently saved version prior to the date
specification. Versions appearing later than the requested date
specification would be unsuitable because they would contain changes
that occurred after the time at which the content was cited by the
link. </a> <a name=backref23> The date specification format should comply
with RFC&#160;1123 [</a><a href=#ref23>23</a>] or ANSI&#160;C's
<tt>asctime()</tt> except that spaces are replaced by underscores. A
date extended URI is shown in <a href=#figure4>Figure&#160;4</a>.

</table>
</center>

<p align=justify> Date specifications might be used when referring to
documents that are time sensitive. A weather bulletin is such an example
because of its time dependent nature.  Date specifications might also be
used when attempting to provide a sense of the time relation between
separate documents.  This might apply when reviewing the work histories
of two groups with competing patent claims. Lastly a writer may find
it easier to just append the current time to a URI to reference the
current version of a document.

<p align=justify> As a heuristic guideline, the syntax used should
reflect whether the revision history is of more interest (suggesting
the version syntax) or whether the currency is of more interest
(suggesting the time syntax). For both syntaxes, the mechanism
for retrieval of the appropriate revision is similar. We discuss the
mechanism our system uses next.</a>

<a name=section4>
<H2>4. Apache Module Design and Supporting Software</H2>

<p align=justify> Due to the popularity of the Apache server and the
availability of its source code, we decided that Apache with its API was
an appropriate server for adding the necessary functionality for
handling version and date extended URIs. Apache's modular software
design allows second party modules to be easily incorporated into the
server. System administrators can install Apache with the modules of
their choosing providing the server with the functionality necessary for
their particular site.

<p align=justify> </a> <a name=backref24> In designing a new module to handle
content permanence, it is desirable to follow the API that Apache
provides for module design [</a><a href=#ref24>24</a>]. Apache
modules are designed with one or more standard functions. Each function
is associated with some stage of the request processing. During each
stage the corresponding functions from each module are called by the
server core.  The stages that the new content permanence module uses are
<i>fixup</i>, <i>handler</i>, and <i>logger</i>. These stages are called
in the following order.

<ul>

  <li><i>Fixup</i> is the first of these stages called and does
preprocessing of the request. Each module containing a fixup function
is called before the server proceeds to the next stage.

<p align=justify>
  <li>Next, the <i>handler</i> function is called for the module that
will need to respond to the client with the requested document.  The
handler function either responds to the client with the resource
requested by the client, or "redirects" the request. Redirection can be
either internal or external. Internal redirection causes the server to
serve a different URI.  An external redirection sends the client a new
URI and the client makes a new request for that URI.  The <i>handler</i>
function that is called is selected prior to the <i>fixup</i> stage
based on the MIME type of the requested resource. During the
<i>fixup</i> stage, the handler function can be reselected if desired.

<p align=justify>
  <li>Next, the <i>logger</i> function of each module having such a
function is called. The <i>logger</i> function commonly records log
information in a log file, though any type of cleanup operation 
can be performed here.</ul>

<p align=justify> The fixup routine for the new content permanence
module checks to determine if the requested document is under RCS
control. It does so by checking for an RCS file with the same name as
the requested document followed by a ",v" extension. This file if it
exists resides in the RCS subdirectory under the directory from which
the document is being requested. If the file is under RCS control, the
fixup routine in the new module calls code to extract the appropriate
 revision of the file from the RCS revision repository and store it in
a temporary file.  The server then is internally redirected to access
this file. In the event that the request was for a revision listing,
such a listing is returned and no redirection is necessary. When the
request is completed, the new module's logger routine removes the
temporary file.

<p align=justify> Various configuration file commands control the new
module. One specifies the directory for storing temporary files. Another
enables or disables the module. The system can be configured to allow or
disallow override of this command in <tt>.htaccess</tt> files.

<p align=justify> In conjunction with this software, software has been
developed to process an HTML document and add date specifications to
each URI.  Currently the date specifications represent the time at
which the software was run. This software is being augmented to check
each link to determine if it points to a document under revision
control and if so what the most recent version is. Only links to
documents under revision control will be considered by this program
for augmentation with date specifications.  Those links could either
be augmented by default or augmented if the user responds positively
to a prompt.  

<a name=section5>
<H2>5. Conclusion</H2>

<p align=justify> This paper describes our approach to supporting
permanence in the content referred to by links in HTML documents.  Thus
it aims at preserving the traditional approach of new work building upon
an unchanging foundation of previous work.  

<p align=justify> In our solution, the server retrieves the correct
version of a document based on the version or date specification
suffix appended to a URI. Documents under revision control must be
maintained using systems based on RCS. Other revision systems could be
used but would require modifications to the new content permanence
Apache module.  The new module is built using the standard Apache API.
This new module uses code from the generally available RCS revision
control system.  Because it supports serving URIs augmented with date
or version specifications in a distributed manner, using the existing
Apache module API for accessibility and low cost, it is suitable for
widespread, incremental application.  It requires no special client
programs. The modified Apache server we have developed also
understands ordinary URIs without version or date suffixes. We also
described our working prototype program for transforming ordinary URI
links in an HTML file into URIs containing appropriate date
specifications. The additional features that we plan to add to the
existing system will serve to better meet the goal of an accessible,
workable system for encouraging content permanence.

<p align=justify> The importance of having links refer to content which
is permanent is simply, and importantly, to preserve the traditional
system of supporting new work by referencing previous work despite the
ongoing transition to a cyberspace era of digitally stored
references. If referred-to work can change, as is currently the case on
the WWW, that traditional and important system is in jeopardy.

<p align=justify> The new Apache module will soon be thoroughly tested
and documented, and submitted for distribution as an officially
sanctioned Apache module. Our approach and syntax need to be developed
into a form suitable for consideration and approval by the IETF. Work is
needed toward gaining acceptance of the system for use in a digital
library of significant size and impact, and more generally toward
obtaining general acceptance in the WWW community, with all of the
technical development and public acceptance measures that entails.</a>
