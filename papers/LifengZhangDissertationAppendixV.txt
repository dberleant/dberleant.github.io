On the other hand, there was no change of serum levels of <Chemical Synonym="INTERLEUKIN-1">IL-1</Chemical> and <Chemical Synonym="INTERLEUKIN-8">IL-8</Chemical> serum levels of <Chemical Synonym="INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST PROTEIN">IL-1ra</Chemical> and <Chemical Synonym="INTERLEUKIN-6">IL-6</Chemical> even increased at the end of single PE, in spite of high levels of all cytokines and adhesion molecules in plasmafiltrate.

<Chemical Synonym="Amrinone">Amrinone</Chemical> produces in these preparations a proportionally larger increase in cardiac output than in <Chemical Synonym="Oxygen">oxygen</Chemical> consumption, thus this agent increases cardiac efficiency.

The stimuli included: (1) a silicone contact lens; (2) a silicone contact lens in combination with anoxia; (3) anoxia alone; (4) a thick hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) contact lens; and (5) a gas mixture of 9.8% <Chemical Synonym="CO2">carbon dioxide</Chemical>, 20.5% <Chemical Synonym="Oxygen">oxygen</Chemical>, and the balance <Chemical Synonym="Nitrogen">nitrogen.</Chemical>

Recently we have reported the molecular characterisation of a single-domain <Chemical Synonym="Cellulase">endoglucanase</Chemical> from Cellvibrio mixtus, suggesting that some <Chemical Synonym="Cellulase">cellulases</Chemical> produced by this aerobic bacterium preferentially hydrolyse soluble cellulosic <Chemical Synonym="SUBSTRATE">substrates.</Chemical>

1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)transactivates the avian beta 3 <Chemical Synonym="INTEGRIN">integrin</Chemical> gene whose promoter contains at least two <Chemical Synonym="Vitamin">vitamin</Chemical> D response elements, one of which is in close proximity to a candidate <Chemical Synonym="Multiple">AP1</Chemical> site (TGACTCA).

These data indicate that <Chemical Synonym="APOLIPOPROTEIN E">apoE</Chemical> phenotype modulates the <Chemical Synonym="LIPOPROTEIN">LDL</Chemical> <Chemical Synonym="Cholesterol">cholesterol</Chemical>-lowering response to a diet meeting NCEP Step 1 criteria, and that male subjects carrying the apoE4 <Chemical Synonym="Multiple">allele</Chemical> are more responsive than other subjects.

Effective reduction of plasma <Chemical Synonym="Lipid">lipids</Chemical> and <Chemical Synonym="LIPOPROTEIN">lipoproteins</Chemical> is associated with a decline in the prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and cardiovascular mortality.
