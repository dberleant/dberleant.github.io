Bibliography for qualitative-quantitative reasoning
===================================================

Compiled by: Daniel Berleant, djb@engr.uark.edu

Note: Boundaries on what constitutes qualitative-quantitative
reasoning are vague. There is no intention here to implicitly define
it.  However, neither is any attempt made to give a comprehensive
listing of work in many fields with their own identities; only a few
words are listed in e.g.  temporal reasoning and system dynamics.
  I've included what people sent, with no real attempt to judge
suitability for this particular bibliography.
  This bibliography ends in February, 1993.

 Thank you.

The papers are related to our work in analogical reasoning a sub-field
of qualitative reasoning.  Analogical representations are a technique
in which properties of physical objects are represented in a direct,
pictorial way. Usually these representation are combined with
simulation techniques based on local information inspired by naive
observations of physical phenomena. [Gambardella et al.]
