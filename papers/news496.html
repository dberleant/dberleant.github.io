<H2><CENTER>Beware the N of One</CENTER>
</H2>
<P><CENTER><B>Written by Lynn Sorenson. </B></CENTER>
<P>Good teaching - how would we know it if we saw it? Lest we come across
sounding like the court justice who exclaimed that he could not describe
pornography but &quot;knew it when [he] saw it,&quot; let us attempt to
describe the characteristics of good college teaching. This is particularly
important now as faculty members are invited with greater frequency to observe
their colleagues' classes and provide input for summative evaluation. 
<P><CENTER><B>Consider this definition of teaching: </B></CENTER>
<P>Helping someone else learn.(1) Good teaching then, would be good ways
- or even the best ways - of helping others learn.(2) Sometimes we assume
students learn in the same way we learn, and we define &quot;good teaching&quot;
as teaching that reflects our own learning styles. It is also tempting to
take our own teaching methods as the standard of good practice rather than
measuring teaching performance against specific criteria. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, there is danger in using oneself (an N of one) as the measure
of good teaching/learning without regard to current research on teaching,
student learning styles, and effective methods. Fortunately, currently research
(3) is remarkably consistent in suggesting teaching techniques, behaviors,
and attitudes that help college students learn with the greatest facility
and retention. 
<P><CENTER><B>Fostering personal relationships in learning: <BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>Students learn more when they feel connected both to the instructor and
with other students involved in the learning process. Methods that facilitate
these personal relationships include active and cooperative learning activities
and faculty availability-both inside and outside of class time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD><TD ALIGN=left width=50%>
<P><CENTER><B>Establishing high expectations:<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>These expectations must be communicated early (usually the first day
of class) and reiterated throughout the semester, both in writing and orally.
Frequent, meaningful writing and other assignments provide students with
the opportunity to perform often, receive feedback, and revise when necessary.
Inherent in maintaining these high standards is the expectation that the
instructor will provide timely and frequent feedback.&nbsp; 
<P><CENTER><B>Understanding and respecting students' varied talents and
ways of learning: </B></CENTER>
<P>Creative teachers are (or become) aware of various methods of teaching
that take into account students' strengths and weaknesses, their cultural
and experiential differences, and their vastly varied ways of knowing and
learning. This means college teachers must be open to new ways of rethinking
old paradigms, entertaining student (and other) suggestions, and taking
risks as they try innovations-not all of which will be successful. [See
Bonwell, p.3 of this issue.] <BR>
<BR>
Peer observers (especially if they are serving as summative evaluators)
must beware of another N of one. We need to remember that one or two visits
to a colleague's classroom provide only &quot;snapshots&quot; of teaching-and
indeed, the snapshots are of a process. A teaching portfolio (or dossier)
needs many snapshots-students evaluations, syllabi, student work, teaching
goals, and specific outcome-based measurements. When an album of snapshots
is collected, it becomes a collage of a person's teaching. Only then can
it be reviewed for its value as &quot;good teaching.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B>1.</B> Summative evaluation is used for personnel decisions (continuing
status, promotion and tenure, raises, etc.), in contrast with formative
evaluation, which is feedback provided to a teacher solely for the purpose
of improving instruction.&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>

<B>Tip on Using Mid-Course Evaluations</B><BR>
by Dan Berleant, Asst. Prof., <BR>
<BR>
Computer Systems Engineering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>Mid-course evaluation forms have been recommended as one way to find
out how a course is going while there is still time left in the semester
to make useful changes. Open-ended questions are useful in drawing out student
concerns. Two questions that I have heard and used are: <BR>
<BR>
(1) What about this course is good and should stay the same? <BR>
(2) What about this course could be better? <BR>
<BR>
But does one student's explicit suggestion represent an opinion shared by
more of the class, or would a change to suit that student actually make
things worse for many others? I address this issue by distributing a follow-up
questionnaire with specific, yes/no or multiple choice questions derived
from the actual suggestions and comments that the original questionnaire
elicited. Tabulating the answers helps clarify what changes would be welcomed
by the class. Informing the students of the results helps them to understand
any decisions you make.

<B>Summer Faculty Teaching Retreat II, 1996 </B></CENTER>
<P>Fifty-two faculty members from across campus have been accepted for participation
in the 1996 Summer Faculty Teaching Retreat. The camp will be at Western
Hills Lodge, July 29-August 2, 1996. Last year's tradition of stimulating
sessions, continuous interaction and recreation will be continued. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<B>Effective University Teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>A focus group of six students from a variety of disciplines and professional
schools recently shared with the Office of Instructional Development and
Technology staff their perspectives on teaching and learning at Dalhousie
University. (Taken from the March/April 1996 edition of &quot;Focus on University
Teaching and Learning&quot; published by Dalhousie University in Halifax,
Nova Scotia, Canada.) The students said they learn best from professors
who:&nbsp; 
<UL>
<LI>show respect and concern for students 
<LI>develop rapport with students 
<LI>stimulate learning in the classroom 
<LI>provide timely and useful feedback on student work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</UL>
The following are effective and ineffective teaching practices as gleaned
from the group interview. 
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<P><B>Effective Teachers.... </B>
<UL>
<LI>Pause during a lecture to ask if there are any questions-and mean it.
<LI>Write key words, phrases, and important names on the board. 
<LI>Prepare classes thoroughly, using humor, fostering debate, giving practical,
current examples. 
<LI>Welcome students to &quot;drop in&quot; to their offices. 
<LI>Meet and interact informally with students outside class in a relaxed
atmosphere. 
<LI>Show interest in students as individuals by engaging in &quot;personal-level
conversations&quot; with them; thus students are motivated to do well in
the course to please the teacher. 
<LI>Show respect for student opinion to the point of asking the class for
suggestions to improve an article in the works, reporting when the article
was accepted for publication. 
<LI>Show concern for student achievement by going out of the way to contact
a student to deal with a potential problem. 
<LI>Provide ample comments and a full explanation of how a mark was determined,
prompting students to report &quot;we know where we're going.&quot; 
<LI>Recognize that students have other classes and responsibilities and
show some flexibility in assignment&nbsp;&nbsp;deadlines. 
<LI>Accept major assignments in draft form, give feedback (including a grade),
and allow students to re-submit an improved version for a higher grade.
</UL>
<P><CENTER><B>Ineffective Teachers... </B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>Make class a &quot;note-taking race.&quot;&nbsp; 
<LI>Use overheads crammed with too much text. 
<LI>Lecture by reading aloud from the textbook without permitting questions
or interruption. 
<LI>Refuse to see students without an appointment. 
<LI>Communicate with students outside class exclusively by electronic mail,
unnecessarily limiting student-teacher interaction. 
<LI>Convey a sense of superiority to students with the message&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because
I have a Ph.D., I am always right.&quot; 
<LI>Show little respect for students, to the point of getting &quot;kicks&quot;
from a position of power, proudly claiming to be &quot;the prof from hell.&quot;
<LI>Appear to lack commitment to the class by accumulating frequent, unannounced
absences. 
<LI>Provide little comment and feedback, even limiting remarks on an A+
paper to &quot;Not bad.&quot; 
<LI>Employ unyielding policy about deadlines for student work while returning
graded assignments to students months after they're submitted. 
<LI>Administer mid-term exams without having returned any previous assignments
prompting a student to observe that &quot;You need to know how you're doing
along the way. Otherwise, you're just floating.
